He described in detail what went on in his head when he did mathematics. He acknowledged his total inability to read any math book, even the most simple, if he didn’t manage to fabricate the right pictures in his head. He also acknowledged his inability to follow along during conferences because they always went too fast for him. He explained his way of getting by with the feeling of not knowing anything. And most of all he explained the exact place where he was finding pleasure in all that.]]


To read them or to not read them ?
[[Mathematica_A_Secret_World_of_Intuition_and_Curiosity_(David_Bessis).pdf#page=46&selection=13,0,24,28|Here I was, decades later, buried under thousands of books and tens of thousands of articles, none of which I understood. How could I hope to invent something original? One day, I heard about a recent book on a subject that was useful—but not central—to my research. Everyone was saying that this book was very clear and well written. Which made me want to read it. After a week, I hadn’t even made it to the third page. Demoralized, I went to ask the help of my friend Raphael Rouquier, a young math prodigy I shared an office with. His reaction remains engraved in my memory: “Come on, David! Didn’t anyone ever tell you that you should never read math books? Didn’t they tell you they’re impossible to read?”]]

The effort will be almost as intense as that which allowed the author to write the book, and it will lead you to understand the matter almost as well as the author does]]

if you want to, then you have to get ready for a few months of harworks?

Raphael balanced books on his forearm and held the top of the binding with the fingers of one hand, which left the other hand free to turn the pages very quickly. His technique was simple enough. He never started at the beginning, but wherever he felt like. It wasn’t a reading technique as much as a nonreading technique.]]

Maybe you want to understand an idea you’ve run into somewhere, to know if a certain statement is correct or not, or to get an idea of how to prove it. What really interests you might be Definition 7.4 on page 138, Theorem 11.5 on page 227, or maybe just a particular passage in its proof.]]

If that stops you from understanding the rest, you’ll want to go back to the definitions. That’s okay. Or you’ll manage to muddle through anyway. That’s okay too.]]

At any rate the book should never dictate the agenda. We’re the ones asking the questions.]]

I guess don't start at the beginning, traverse through the the details and see what you can do almost. what you can understand.
