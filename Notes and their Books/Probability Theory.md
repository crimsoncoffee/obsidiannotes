Conditional Probability
	How $P(A|B$ and $P(B|A)$ are diffrerent
	first of all they are not some events
		$P(A|B)=\frac{P\left( A\cap B \right)}{P(B)}$

[[Introduction to Probability, Second Edition (Joseph K.

For further intuition, imagine that someone spreads out the cards and draws one card with their left hand and another card with their right[[Introduction to Probability, Second Edition (Joseph K.

Defining A and B based on the left hand’s card and the right hand’s card rather than the first card and second card would not change the structure of the problem in any important way.]]
