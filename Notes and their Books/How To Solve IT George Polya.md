***Getting Acquainted***
	[[How to Solve It A New Aspect of Mathematical Method (George Polya).pdf#page=54&selection=4,0,4,21&color=yellow|Where should I start?]]
		Before doing anything, just start at the statement of the problem, 
	**What Can I do?**
		Visualize the problem as deeply you can.
			Do not concern with the details at that moment
	What can you gain by doing so?
		Understanding. Familiarizing. Impressing its **Purpose** on the mind. And let the memory after attention bestowed be stimulated to recollection of points and ideas that may come handy.
***Working for Better Understanding***

	**What can you gain by doing so?**
		Preparing and clarifying the details
***Hunting for the Helpful Idea***
	==**Where Should I start?**==
		Consideration of the principle parts of the problem. When they are clearly arranged and clearly conceived. When the memory is responsive due to your previous work.
	==**What Can I do?**==
		 Considering the problem from the various sides. Seeking contacts with the former knowledge.
		 Emphasizing different parts, by examining the details,
		 and the same details again in different ways. Combining these details
		 approaching them from different sides.
		 Seeing new meaning in each of the detail.
		 Or a new interpretation of the same detail or under different consideration.
	 ==**What could I perceive?**==
		 An idea that is helpful by giving you the glance at the very end.
		 *How can the idea be helpful?*
			 Shows the whole way or Part of the way.
			 Showing you how you can proceed.
			 The mere moment you have a more or less complete idea you are lucky.
	 ==**What to do with an Incomplete Idea**==
		 Consider it. Longer, if it looks advantageous. Reliable, ascertaining how far it leads you, reconsider the situation. If the situation has changed thanks to the helpful idea, consider the new situation and approach it in the above and below manner.
	 ==**What is done by doing it again and again?**==
		 You may get an another idea.
		 Just be grateful for all the new the new ideas that keep coming due to the above activity. 
			 [[How to Solve It A New Aspect of Mathematical Method (George Polya).pdf#page=55&selection=84,36,90,16|Nevertheless you should be grateful for all new ideas, also for the lesser ones, also for the hazy ones, also for the supplementary ideas adding some precision to a hazy one, or attempting the correction of a less fortunate one. Even if you do not have any appreciable new ideas for a while you should be grateful if your conception of the problem becomes more complete or more coherent, more homogeneous or better balanced.]]
**Carrying out the Plan**
	Where to start?
		From the lucky idea that would lead to the solution.
		When you seem to have the grasp of the of the main connection and feel confident that you can apply the minor details
	What can you do?
		Make that grasp quite secure. Carry through the detail in all the algebraic or geometric operations that you have recognized feasible.
		'Convincing yourself of the correctness of the solution' more than checking.
		By formal reasoning, or intuitive insight or both.
		Great steps composed of smaller steps. Check Greats then their smalls.
	 What to gain by doing so?
		 A presentation of the solution at each step correct beyond doubt
**Looking back**
	Where should you start?
		From the solution. Correct and complete in each detail
	What can you do?
		Again considering the solution from the various sides and seeking contact with formerly acquired knowledge
		Making them as simple as you can and being able to see the solution at glance.
		To modify the smaller or larger parts of the solution to their advantage.
		Improving the whole solution making intuitive so that it fits your formerly acquired knowledge as naturally as possible.
		**Scrutinize** the method that lead you to the solution. 
		Seeing the point of the solution.
		Do the same with the result to.
	What you can gain by doing so?
		You may find a new better method. Solution. You may discover interesting facts. 
		The habit of surveying and scrutinizing your solutions this way will result in well ordered acquisition of the knowledge.

Some are accepted as primitive terms and are not defined. Others are considered as derived terms and are defined in due form; that is, their meaning is stated in primitive terms and in formerly defined derived terms. Thus, we do not give a formal definition of such primitive notions as point, straight line, and plane.3 Yet we give formal definitions of such notions as “bisector of an angle” or “circle” or “parabola.”]]
