Scarcity contributing heavily to the abundance of sorrows and sins.
Yoke of scarcity and studies of behavior intended to minimize.

[[Universal Economics.pdf#page=29&selection=40,11,42,25&color=yellow|We will show how and why the modes of coordination in a basically private property, individualistic society have dominated all others in productivity, growth, and freedom.]]

Goods being more desirable, than there lets desirable counterparts.
	Good desirable, but is abundant then it is a free good, provided that no one sort of wants it any more.[[Universal Economics.pdf#page=30&selection=41,21,43,10&color=yellow|The classic case of a free good, to most of us most of the time, is air: we simply inhale, and there it is, without our sacrificing anything to obtain it.]]   But it is an economic good to an astronaut or  a resident of city  in a smoggy day.
		[[Universal Economics.pdf#page=30&selection=45,9,47,19&color=yellow|“free good” does not mean something for which a zero price is charged, like “free education,” “freeways,” “free public parks,” “free libraries,” and “free beaches.”]]. 
		as [[Universal Economics.pdf#page=31&selection=7,0,8,8&color=yellow|long as someone thinks they are desirable and wants more — that makes them “goods.”]]
		
**Self Interest**
[[Universal Economics.pdf#page=31&selection=14,52,15,72&color=yellow|means you want more power to control resources, whether for your own or for someone else’s benefit
	[[Universal Economics.pdf#page=31&selection=21,40,22,65&color=yellow|how our market actions benefit other people, even if we are not deliberately trying to help them]]  B[[Universal Economics.pdf#page=31&selection=22,68,24,53&color=yellow|oth parties to an exchange must anticipate a gain; otherwise there would be no markets and voluntarily negotiated exchanges of private property.]]    


**Competition**
Violence 
	State has the near monopoly on violence and it tries to reduce it as much except from contact sports.
	

Political power
	[[Universal Economics.pdf#page=32&annotation=5308R|hen we complain about high government taxes or expenditures, we are commonly complaining about our neighbors whose interests conflict with ours.]]
Discrimination
		[[Universal Economics.pdf#page=32&annotation=5311R|All competition and choice is discriminatory. Choice is merely another name for discrimination— to rank alternatives according to some attribute.]]
			[[Universal Economics.pdf#page=33&annotation=5314R|not discrimination that is condemned, but “invidious” discrimination — by whatever criteria enough people consider undesirable]]
	First Come, First Served
		[[Universal Economics.pdf#page=33&annotation=5317R|cost would be incurred in getting to the campus before dawn in an effort to get a space. Costs need not be in money payments. A zero price does not make something free.]]
	Most Deserving
	[[Universal Economics.pdf#page=33&annotation=5320R|could be avoided by prior assignment to the most “deserving” or “needy.”]] [[Universal Economics.pdf#page=33&annotation=5323R|no limit to the ingenuity of dispensing committees in rationalizing their favors]] 
	 [[Universal Economics.pdf#page=33&annotation=5326R|should those who are awarded rights to a parking space be allowed to sell the rights to others?]]
 Jungle or Civilized Competition
	 [[Universal Economics.pdf#page=33&annotation=5329R|a society with reliable private property rights and readily available markets for exchange of those rights has proven to be conducive to greater production and civilized behavior than a society that condones violence or brute force in resolving differences of opinions about use of economic resources.]]


Primary Focus of Economic analysis
Competitive cooperation by exchanges
	1. Competition in exchange of rights to services and goods.
	2. coordinated cooperation in creating wealth. 
	 [[Universal Economics.pdf#page=33&annotation=5332R|Competition by offers of exchange is a form of cooperation. “I’ll do this for you if you’ll do that for me — at better terms than someone else.”]]
	[[Universal Economics.pdf#page=33&annotation=5335R|Any effective combination of cooperation and competition requires a control of the permissible types of competition so as to not obstruct social cohesion and cooperation.]]
**Intent**
	[[Universal Economics.pdf#page=34&annotation=5338R|A few examples of such common errors are:]]


Sequence of Exposition and Unsolicited advice for Study

[[Universal Economics.pdf#page=36&annotation=5360R|Sometimes they supersede dictates of physics. The law of gravity says, “If you drop a $20 bill on the ground, it will stay there.” Economics says, “If you drop a $20 bill on the ground, it will quickly disappear.]]

[[Universal Economics.pdf#page=36&annotation=5363R|questions and meditations]]
	[[Universal Economics.pdf#page=36&annotation=5366R|If people were reasonable and acted with justice and good faith, there would be no strikes, no economic problems, and no wars.” Do you agree? Answer: False. It is because people are reasonable and, therefore, act in accord with their own interest that there are economic problems and wars.]]


### **Chapter 2**
Your Economic Society (As this book is for the American readers Alchian talks in that perspective)
	**Rights and Property Rights**
		[[Universal Economics.pdf#page=41&annotation=5410R|Your property right to the car rests on the willingness and ability of other people, not your ability alone, to protect your control over that resource — your property.]]
		[[Universal Economics.pdf#page=43&annotation=5416R|Your rights determine your status and potential welfare and your “freedoms”— what the rest of society will let you do]]
		[[Universal Economics.pdf#page=43&annotation=5430R|underlying natures, people are everywhere much the same, but in different societies they may act within very different contexts and restraints and incentives — the ground rules differ.]]
		-
		**Private Property Rights**
			1. Right to make decisions about the physical conditions and uses of specified goods
			2. the right to sell the rights of ownership to other people
			3.  right to enjoy the resulting income and to bear the loss of the use decision.
			Exclusive rights belonging to the same person.
		[[Universal Economics.pdf#page=44&annotation=5439R|Constitutional scholars make a distinction between “negative rights,” which limit what governments can do, versus the notion of “positive rights,” which would require government actions to benefit some people at the expense of other people.]]
		[[Universal Economics.pdf#page=44&annotation=5439R|Constitutional scholars make a distinction between “negative rights,” which limit what governments can do, versus the notion of “positive rights,” which would require government actions to benefit some people at the expense of other people.]]
		Physical Attributes, Not Market Values
			[[Universal Economics.pdf#page=44&annotation=5442R|I can’t legally use my hammer to break your windows. But you are not protected from market-value effects caused by a reduced demand for your property.]]
			[[Universal Economics.pdf#page=44&annotation=5445R|When buying private property rights to something, first identify what the rights include and what is excluded. The less that is included, the lower the market value will be]]
				for the case of blocking your view of something by the property owner of something..
		Alienability of Private Property rights.
			[[Universal Economics.pdf#page=45&annotation=5448R|In England, until about one hundred years ago, major land holdings were not “alienable.” They passed from parent to child. All the “owner-occupant” could do was live on it or enjoy its income if rented to someone else. In China, publicly traded companies issue shares of “ownership” that are not resalable without government approval. In Switzerland, until a couple of decades ago, shares in many publicly traded corporations could not be sold to other people unless the buyer was approved by the corporate directors.]]
			- [[Universal Economics.pdf#page=45&annotation=5451R|There are reasons for not having private property rights in some institutions, such as “not-for-profit” hospitals, colleges, museums, fraternities, and sororities — and we’ll see later some of these reasons.]]
		Torts
			[[Universal Economics.pdf#page=45&annotation=5454R|another kind of “property right.” A taking or using of another person’s property in an emergency is called a “tort.”]] 
			-[[Universal Economics.pdf#page=45&annotation=5462R|A more common example of a tort occurs when you berth your boat on my dock (with or without my permission), but because of some proven negligence on my part your boat is damaged or you are injured. In such cases, courts may force me to compensate you.]]
		 Rule against Perpetuities
			 [[Universal Economics.pdf#page=46&annotation=5465R|The “dead hand of the past” is not allowed to overrule the “invisible hand” of future generations’ market values.]]
	**Capitalist of Socialist**
		private property rights [[Universal Economics.pdf#page=46&annotation=5468R|extent to which they apply.]] 
			- [[Universal Economics.pdf#page=46&annotation=5471R|economy with extensive private property rights over most resources is usually called a “capitalist” economy]]
			-  [[Universal Economics.pdf#page=46&annotation=5474R|anticipated future consequences of present uses of resources are “capitalized” into current market values of the resources, as we’ll be examining]]
			- [[Universal Economics.pdf#page=46&annotation=5477R|what those capitalized market values reflect, and how they influence our behavior and uses of resources, is one of the basic achievements of economic analysis.]]
			- **[[Universal Economics.pdf#page=46&annotation=5480R|To incorporate anticipation into present values requires establishing and maintaining consistency of actions among the populace. That has to be done in an economy in which decisions and adjustments are independent in the sense that each person makes choices without requiring permission from someone else.]]** [[Universal Economics.pdf#page=46&annotation=5483R|decisions are dependent in that they depend on what other people are expected to do.]]
	**Free Speech is not Free resources** 
			[[Universal Economics.pdf#page=47&annotation=5489R|A right of free speech is not an “economically free” right. It uses scarce resources. “Free speech” means the right to communicate with your own resources to other willing listeners — without political intervention about what you say.]]
			**[[Universal Economics.pdf#page=47&annotation=5492R|(1) use of one’s owned or rented resources by the speaker and (2) a willing listener, are often ignored.]]**
		[[Universal Economics.pdf#page=47&annotation=5495R|You are an unwilling recipient. Both required conditions of free speech are violated. Your computer is being used without your permission, and you are not a willing recipient of the messages.]]	
	**Efficiency and the Constrained Maximum concept**
	- [[Universal Economics.pdf#page=48&annotation=5503R|An efficiently produced amount of some good is a “constrained maximum” of that good.]]
	- [[Universal Economics.pdf#page=48&annotation=5506R|More of a specified good requires reduced production of some other goods.]]
	- [[Universal Economics.pdf#page=49&annotation=5509R|But the “electricity energy-efficient refrigerator” costs more to produce. Whether the saving in electricity is worth more than the increased cost of production of the refrigerator is the pertinent question, not the fact that less electricity is used.]]
	- [[Universal Economics.pdf#page=49&annotation=5512R|concept of “efficient” is different from the concept of an unconstrained, or “unconditional,” maximum.]]   [[Universal Economics.pdf#page=49&annotation=5515R|maximum housing, with nothing else. We’d all starve in nice homes.]]
	Efficiency desirable?
		[[Universal Economics.pdf#page=49&annotation=5521R|ou’ll be told you’re considering the wrong alternatives, and therefore the efficiency for your set of possible goods is irrelevant.]]  [[Universal Economics.pdf#page=49&annotation=5524R|Therefore, “efficiency” is not a basis for choosing among alternative “efficient” combinations.]]
		- [[Universal Economics.pdf#page=49&annotation=5524R|Therefore, “efficiency” is not a basis for choosing among alternative “efficient” combinations.]]
		- [[Universal Economics.pdf#page=50&annotation=5530R|But which of all the points on the boundary — all the efficient points — is most desirable has not been answered.]]
	**Meaning of a Theory**
			[[Universal Economics.pdf#page=50&annotation=5533R|Principles form a “science” if people can deduce from those principles consequences as a result of specified initial events. If those implied consequences happen reliably, that set of principles is a “science.”]]
	**Economic Analysis Positive, Not Normative**
		if this, then that.
			does not tell you what is GOOD or BAD
			[[Universal Economics.pdf#page=50&annotation=5536R|Economics does not tell us (imply) that governments should be smaller]]
			[[Universal Economics.pdf#page=51&annotation=5539R|Economics can foretell some of the consequences of a law or event, and you can then decide for yourself whether the prior action is desirable. Whether some event or consequence is good or bad is not implied, indicated, or deducible solely from economic theory.]]
			Not telling if one thing is better than the other. 
		**Increased or Reduced Probability and Refutable Implications**
			What may or might happen is useless.
			a. what will or will not happen
			b. the probability of the event
			c. what raises or lowers the probability.
		**Reported Versus verified event**
			be careful in placing heavy reliance of first reports, they can be misrepresented.
		**Transient Lucky Event Versus Basic Difference: The Ubiquitous Regression Effect**
			High probability of a continued good luck to be followed by a continued good luck.[[Universal Economics.pdf#page=51&annotation=5550R|Of one hundred identical salespeople, some would, by good luck, have higher sales than others in any one week. But in the next week those who were unusually lucky in the first week would more likely get fewer sales, nearer their long-run averages. Similarly, those with very bad luck the first week would not have such bad luck the next week, so in the second week their sales would improve.]]
				Regress toward their long run average.
		**Economics Versus Economists**
			What an economist can do is to deduce some of the consequences of the proposed at better than (presumably) than a noneconomist.
			[[Universal Economics.pdf#page=52&annotation=5553R|But definitely to assess and appraise whether the consequences of the action are good or bad is, to the economist, forbidden fruit. Yet, like Adam, many economists eat of it.]]
		**Which Economic Theory**	
			Principle's of economics forming the economic theory are intended to be reliable and useful guides to understanding economic events.
			[[Universal Economics.pdf#page=52&annotation=5556R|Don’t make the intellectual mistake of asking whether the theory (the set of principles) is “true.” No theory is perfect. Ask instead, “Is it useful and reliable enough for my purposes? That is, will it lead to generally correct implications and guidance at sufficiently low cost without intolerable error?” That’s the question to ask in every discipline, whether Chemistry, Physics, Biology, or Economics.]]
			- [[Universal Economics.pdf#page=53&annotation=5559R|There is not one economic theory for capitalism and another for socialism and another for some other form of economy. The situation parallels biology. The same biological principles hold no matter where animals and people live. In every society, the basic principles of human behavior are the same.]]
		**Economics and Biology**
			[[Universal Economics.pdf#page=53&annotation=5562R|Economics is part of “biology”— the study of life]] [[Universal Economics.pdf#page=53&annotation=5565R|dominant in the “market” for the production and distribution of desired goods and services.]]   
		**The Basic unit of Analysis is the Individual, Not a group**
			[[Universal Economics.pdf#page=53&annotation=5568R|Economics assumes that choices are made by individuals, not by a group, family, business, or government.]]   [[Universal Economics.pdf#page=53&annotation=5571R|it is some person who is doing something.]]   [[Universal Economics.pdf#page=53&annotation=5579R|But our focus is on an individual’s chosen action.]]

### **Chapter 3**
Choice and Cost
	[[Universal Economics.pdf#page=60&annotation=5659R|Don’t confuse the undesirable features of a chosen act with its cost — the best alternative given up. The cost of “studying and getting a headache” is the “best opportunity” thereby given up, which may be the two hours of playing video games you give up in order to study.]]
	**Explicit and Implicit costs**
		Cost of Use.
		Cost of purchase or rights.
		[[Universal Economics.pdf#page=60&selection=57,31,67,16|even already owned resources are not costless to use, because their use for “this” means giving up the opportunity to use them for “that.”]]
	Precisely what is the action?
		[[Universal Economics.pdf#page=60&selection=106,2,134,22|The cost is $1,000, because your wealth is reduced by only $1,000 when you purchase the car ($1,000 = $20,000 minus the immediate resale value of $19,000). Only $1,000 is initially forsaken.]]
	Prices versus Full cost
		[[Universal Economics.pdf#page=61&selection=34,61,41,15|the $18 full cost without the agent compared to $15 with the agent.]]
	Expenditure versus Purchases
		Not a cost if already obliged to pay.
		It was a cost the vert moment the obligation was made.
		You are only fulfilling your obligations.
		At that moment you gave the right of what you are thinking of a cost now.
	Changes in Implicit Cost
		Depreciation reduction in current value not the initial value of purchase.
			15000 dollar/100000 mile
			50000/100000 mile if the value increases. It is dependent on the life and the miles you drive hence for mile you take the life of the value of the car that could be sold for is decreasing.
			*Misfortune*
				If something happened to your car and it took a value of the car then continuing to depreciate at the lower value car at the amount you were depreciating the higher rate would end you up in negatives.
	Sunk cost is no longer a Cost
		Sunk cost is cost of a past act. Using it to judge the benefit of new venture is fallacy. Any action that you take should not be based on the cost of time or involvement already in it. What's gone is the cost that is already paid. Irrelevant of present or future actions.
		But yeah before incurring such sunk cost at the start it is useful to estimate foreseen sunk cost whether to judge to undertake an action.
	Time used versus Time of use
		Time cannot be a cost because you cannot accumulate it. Hence the only cost of action is the best alternative use of the time. Time required to something cannot be a cost. Alternative action that otherwise could have been accomplished in the same time is the cost.
	**EXTERNALITIES: UNCOMPENSATED EFFECTS BORNE BY OTHER PEOPLE**
		When mutually agreeable compensation for the effects on other people are not made. A purchase has not been for causing the effects. Is an externality.
		Sound, throwing something in front commonly owned place. Legal but incidentally impose cost on other people are externality.
		Trivial harms to other people are permitted if the gains are larger than those harms.
		The same is true for typical trafﬁc noises. In many situations, social customs, rules of etiquette, and ostracism help con- trol our behavior.
		If you owned well-deﬁned and enforceable property rights to air over your land, I would have to compensate you for the right to dump smoke on your property.
		Another example is employee is straining and suffering and the employer is not compensating then it is the externality of the employer for not paying adequately.
	Environmental  Pollution
		Use of a nonowned resource without compensation.
		Internalization of the cost does not happen to reduce or avoid pollution
	Inducing Beneficial Externalities
		Some actions of your improve the resources or environmental of other people.
		Social norms, pressures or rules. Government rules and regulations.
	Pecuniary Externalities
		Physical externalities relate to the physical attributes of the resource in question.
		"Pecuniary" - market value - External effects without the physical impact.
			reducing of market value of something you own due to incoming of something new.
			You do not have the right to market value of the product.

	**CHOICES REFLECT PRINCIPLES OF THE PERSONAL PREFERENCES**
	Individuals are the choosers.
		If you couldn't choose you would have no costs.
		[[Universal Economics.pdf#page=65&annotation=5711R|This direction of attention to individuals does not mean that people are solely self-interested and self- seeking without regard to other people. But we regard individuals as the basic units of choice, no matter what are a person’s motives or ultimate objectives.]]

We leave it to you to try to figure out why the “degree of scarcity” should affect the form of competition that should determine how a scarce resource is allocated among alternative uses and users.
