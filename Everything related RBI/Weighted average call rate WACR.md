Understanding the Weighted Average Call Rate (WACR) is crucial for grasping how the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) implements its monetary policy. Here's a breakdown:

**What is the Call Money Market?**

- The call money market is where banks and other financial institutions borrow and lend funds for very short periods, typically overnight.1
- This is essential for banks to manage their day-to-day liquidity and meet their reserve requirements.2

**What is the Weighted Average Call Rate (WACR)?**

- The WACR is the average **interest rate** at which these overnight funds are borrowed and lent in the call money market.3
- The "**weighted average**" means that the rates are **averaged based on the volume of transactions**. This gives a more accurate picture of the prevailing interest rates in the market.

**WACR and Monetary Policy:**

- The **RBI uses the WACR as its operating target for monetary policy**.4
- Essentially, the RBI aims to keep the WACR closely aligned with the policy repo rate.5
- The repo rate is the interest rate at which the RBI lends money to commercial banks.6
- By managing liquidity in the money market, the RBI influences the WACR.7
- When the RBI wants to tighten monetary policy, it takes measures to **push the WACR upward**, closer to the repo rate. Conversely, when it wants to ease monetary policy, **it takes measures to lower the WACR**.
- The RBI uses a l**iquidity adjustment corridor** which has the **repo rate in the middle**, and the **MSF and SDF rates forming the upper and lower bounds of that corridor**. The RBI works to keep the **WACR within that corridor**.8

**Importance:**

- The WACR is a key indicator of short-term liquidity conditions in the financial system.
- It provides insights into the effectiveness of the RBI's monetary policy actions.
- It influences other short-term interest rates in the economy.9

In summary, the WACR is a vital tool for the RBI in its efforts to maintain price stability and support economic growth.10
