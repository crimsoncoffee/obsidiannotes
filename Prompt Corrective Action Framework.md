Okay, let's talk about the **Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) Framework** in India, which is a crucial supervisory tool used by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).

**What is the PCA Framework?**

The PCA framework is a set of guidelines and structured early intervention mechanisms designed by the RBI for banks and certain other financial institutions that show signs of financial weakness or vulnerability. Its primary goal is to intervene early and require the entity to take corrective measures to restore its financial health before the situation deteriorates further. It's intended to be a supervisory tool, not necessarily punitive.

**Objectives of the PCA Framework:**

1.  **Early Intervention:** To enable supervisory intervention at an appropriate time when the institution's financial health starts showing negative trends.
2.  **Restoration:** To act as a tool to help the supervised entity restore its financial health (e.g., capital adequacy, asset quality).
3.  **Financial Stability:** To protect the interests of depositors and maintain overall financial stability by preventing the failure of weak institutions.

**Applicability (as of April 2025):**

The PCA framework has evolved, and its applicability has been extended over time:

1.  **Scheduled Commercial Banks (SCBs):** The framework has historically applied to SCBs. The **revised PCA framework for SCBs** (excluding Regional Rural Banks, Payment Banks, and Small Finance Banks) came into effect on **January 1, 2022**.
2.  **Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs):** RBI extended a similar PCA framework to certain categories of NBFCs, effective **October 1, 2022**. This applies to:
    * All Deposit-Taking NBFCs (NBFCs-D).
    * Non-Deposit Taking NBFCs in the Middle Layer (NBFC-ND-ML) and Upper Layer (NBFC-ND-UL), including Investment and Credit Companies, Core Investment Companies (CICs), Infrastructure Debt Funds, Infrastructure Finance Companies, Micro Finance Institutions, and Factors. (Government-owned NBFCs are exempt for now).
3.  **Urban Co-operative Banks (UCBs):** RBI has also put in place a revised PCA framework for UCBs, effective from **January 1, 2023** (based on their financial position as of March 31, 2022), with specific thresholds tailored for them.

**Trigger Points and Indicators:**

The RBI monitors specific indicators related to capital, asset quality, and leverage (and previously profitability for banks). If an institution breaches certain predefined thresholds for these indicators, it triggers the PCA framework.

* **For Scheduled Commercial Banks (under the revised 2022 framework):**
    * **Capital:** Capital Adequacy Ratio (CRAR) and Tier 1 Capital Ratio.
    * **Asset Quality:** Net Non-Performing Assets (NNPA) Ratio.
    * **Leverage:** Tier 1 Leverage Ratio.
    * *Note: Profitability (e.g., Return on Assets) was a trigger in the older framework but was removed as a specific trigger point in the 2022 revision, although it remains a key area for monitoring.*

* **For NBFCs:** Similar indicators related to Capital (CRAR/Tier 1 Ratio), Asset Quality (NNPA Ratio), and Leverage Ratio are used, with specific thresholds defined for NBFCs.

* **For UCBs:** Triggers are based on breaches in Net NPA, CRAR, and Tier 1 Capital ratios.

**Risk Thresholds:**
There are typically multiple risk thresholds (e.g., Threshold 1, Threshold 2, Threshold 3) for each indicator. Breaching higher thresholds indicates a more severe financial situation and results in stricter corrective actions.

**Corrective Actions:**

Once PCA is triggered, the RBI imposes certain mandatory and discretionary actions on the institution. These actions become progressively stricter as the risk threshold increases. Examples include:

* **Mandatory Actions (Common across thresholds):**
    * Restriction on dividend distribution/remittance of profits.
    * Promoters/shareholders required to infuse capital.

* **Discretionary Actions (Depending on the threshold level):**
    * Restrictions on branch expansion.
    * Restrictions on capital expenditure (other than for technological upgrades).
    * Curbs on management compensation and directors' fees.
    * Restrictions on certain lending/investment activities.
    * Requirement to formulate and implement a detailed recovery plan.
    * In severe cases, RBI might consider actions related to restructuring, amalgamation, or even resolution of the institution.

**Exit from PCA:**

An institution under PCA can be removed from the framework if the RBI assesses, based on published financial results and supervisory comfort, that the institution is no longer in breach of the risk thresholds and shows sustained improvement in its financial health.

In summary, the PCA framework is a vital part of the RBI's supervisory toolkit designed to identify and address problems in financial institutions proactively, thereby safeguarding the stability of India's financial system.
