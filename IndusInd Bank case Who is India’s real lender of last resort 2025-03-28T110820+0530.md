On 10 March, IndusInd Bank disclosed that an internal review had uncovered a discrepancy in its [rupee-dollar](https://www.livemint.com/topic/forex) swap accounting. The irregularity would erode the bank’s capital base by 2.5%.

*Liquidity scramble and unconventional measures:* Despite RBI’s assurance, IndusInd faced mounting pressure to maintain its liquidity buffers. To shore up liquidity, it issued certificates of deposit (CDs) worth nearly ₹16,000 crore in the weeks after the disclosure. Unusually, large PSBs were the primary buyers. State Bank of India (SBI) alone subscribed to over half the issuances. Media reports suggest RBI played a behind-the-scenes role, persuading PSBs to buy its CDs.

Two aspects of this intervention stand out. First, banks buying CDs issued by peer institutions is uncommon, especially at such scale. Second, the yields on these instruments were significantly higher—by around 30 basis points—than those on similar-tenor CDs issued by the bank before the incident. This reflected the perceived increase in risk.

Ever since Walter Bagehot articulated the principles of LoLR in the 1860s

Sections 17 and 18 of the RBI Act grant the central bank broad authority to lend to distressed banks.

Section 18 empowers RBI to extend on-demand or 90-day loans to “any person," not just banks, without collateral, on such terms as it deems sufficient.

“a special occasion has arisen making it necessary or expedient that action should be taken… for the purpose of regulating credit in the interests of Indian trade, commerce, industry, and agriculture."

why did the central bank avoid using its own balance sheet?

conceivable

IndusInd’s liquidity shortfall as a temporary funding gap

it may have sought to avoid invoking the LoLR mechanism prematurely,

preserving it for systemic events.

direct intervention could have spooked the market further.

Invoking Section 18 may have signalled that IndusInd’s situation was more precarious than publicly disclosed—thereby accelerating deposit flight. This line of reasoning suggests that LoLR’s mere existence serves as a deterrent, akin to nuclear deterrence,

The most likely explanation, however, is that RBI relied on its informal influence over PSBs—effectively using them as a backdoor LOLR mechanism, without officially intervening. While expedient, this raises viability concerns.

PSBs as crisis-funding vehicles will diminish. I

regulatory ‘moral suasion’ may become less effective, underscoring the need for clearer policy signals on when and how RBI will invoke its LoLR authority. More broadly, we need to ask whether informal, opaque interventions can continue to substitute transparent, rule-based central-bank action during periods of financial stress.
