I feel like read slower.

I want to feel like I am reading fast and be reading fast.


> **Reduce “Inner Voice” Dependency:** Since silently “saying” every word can slow you down, practice techniques like silently “seeing” the words as images. Over time, this can help bypass the slower auditory processing.
- **Seeing**
    - Like really you have to just see the words and then quickly move on from them.
        - *Seeing and moving*, images form automatically as you go.
