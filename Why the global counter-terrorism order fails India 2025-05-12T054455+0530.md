One poignant example is the story of the family of the late Haji Mohammad Qasim, whom I first met in a hospital as he tended to his relatives wounded in an attack by Lashkar-e-Taiba terrorists in 2004. He and members of his clan had taken up arms to drive terrorists out of the Pir Panjal hamlets; among the first organised local efforts of resistance. That encounter marked the beginning of many journeys with him through the remote villages of the Pir Panjal range, where I witnessed firsthand their resolve and suffering. Twenty-eight-year-old Syed Adil Hussain Shah’s story in the recent Baisaran attack is another searing example of this ongoing tragedy.
