Let’s dive into this problem with a fresh perspective. We’re given that $d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_k$ are all the factors of a positive integer $n$ , including 1 and $n$ itself, and their sum is $d_1 + d_2 + \ldots + d_k = 72$ . Our goal is to find the value of the sum of their reciprocals, $\frac{1}{d_1} + \frac{1}{d_2} + \ldots + \frac{1}{d_k}$ , and match it to one of the provided options: (A) $\frac{k^2}{72}$ , (B) $\frac{72}{k}$ , (C) $\frac{72}{n}$ , or (D) cannot be computed from the given information.

### Step 1: Understanding the Factors and Their Properties

The numbers $d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_k$ represent the complete list of positive divisors of $n$ . For any positive integer $n$ , if $d$ is a factor, then $\frac{n}{d}$ is also a factor, because $d \cdot \frac{n}{d} = n$ . This suggests that the factors of $n$ typically come in pairs $(d, \frac{n}{d})$ , except possibly when $d = \sqrt{n}$ (if $n$ is a perfect square), where $d = \frac{n}{d}$ , making it a single term in the list. The problem states that the sum of all these factors is 72, which we can write as:

$$
\sum_{i=1}^k d_i = 72
$$

This sum is also known as $\sigma(n)$ , the sum of the divisors of $n$ . Our task is to compute:

$$
\sum_{i=1}^k \frac{1}{d_i}
$$

and express it in terms of the given variables or constants.

### Step 2: Exploring the Sum of Reciprocals

To find $\sum_{i=1}^k \frac{1}{d_i}$ , let’s consider the relationship between the factors. For each factor $d_i$ , there exists a corresponding factor $\frac{n}{d_i}$ , since if $d_i$ divides $n$ , then $\frac{n}{d_i}$ is also an integer and a divisor of $n$ . Because $d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_k$ include all factors of $n$ , the set $\{\frac{n}{d_1}, \frac{n}{d_2}, \ldots, \frac{n}{d_k}\}$ is simply a rearrangement of $\{d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_k\}$ . For example:

- If $d_i = 1$ , then $\frac{n}{d_i} = n$ , both factors of $n$ .
- If $d_i = n$ , then $\frac{n}{d_i} = 1$ , again a factor.
- If $d_i = 2$ (and 2 divides $n$ ), then $\frac{n}{d_i} = \frac{n}{2}$ , another factor.

Since the list includes all factors without repetition, each $\frac{n}{d_i}$ corresponds to some $d_j$ in the list.

Now, rewrite the sum of reciprocals:

$$
\sum_{i=1}^k \frac{1}{d_i}
$$

Notice that:

$$
\frac{1}{d_i} = \frac{\frac{n}{d_i}}{n}
$$

So the sum becomes:

$$
\sum_{i=1}^k \frac{1}{d_i} = \sum_{i=1}^k \frac{\frac{n}{d_i}}{n} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^k \frac{n}{d_i}
$$

### Step 3: Evaluating ∑i=1kndi\\sum\_{i=1}^k \\frac{n}{d\_i}

Since $\frac{n}{d_i}$ is itself a factor of $n$ , and as $i$ ranges from 1 to $k$ , $d_i$ takes on every factor of $n$ exactly once, the values $\frac{n}{d_i}$ also run through all the factors of $n$ exactly once. For instance:

- When $d_i = 1$ , $\frac{n}{d_i} = n$ .
- When $d_i = n$ , $\frac{n}{d_i} = 1$ .
- When $d_i = d$ , $\frac{n}{d_i} = \frac{n}{d}$ , another factor.

Thus, the set $\{\frac{n}{d_1}, \frac{n}{d_2}, \ldots, \frac{n}{d_k}\}$ is a permutation of $\{d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_k\}$ . Therefore:

$$
\sum_{i=1}^k \frac{n}{d_i} = \sum_{i=1}^k d_i
$$

Since we’re given that:

$$
\sum_{i=1}^k d_i = 72
$$

it follows that:

$$
\sum_{i=1}^k \frac{n}{d_i} = 72
$$

### Step 4: Completing the Calculation

Substitute back into our expression:

$$
\sum_{i=1}^k \frac{1}{d_i} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^k \frac{n}{d_i} = \frac{1}{n} \cdot 72 = \frac{72}{n}
$$

This result suggests that the sum of the reciprocals is $\frac{72}{n}$ , which matches option (C). Let’s verify this with an example to ensure correctness.

### Step 5: Verification with an Example

Consider $n = 71$ , a prime number. Its factors are 1 and 71:

- Sum of factors: $1 + 71 = 72$ , which satisfies the given condition.
- Sum of reciprocals: $\frac{1}{1} + \frac{1}{71} = 1 + \frac{1}{71} = \frac{71 + 1}{71} = \frac{72}{71}$ .
- Check option (C): $\frac{72}{n} = \frac{72}{71}$ , which equals $\frac{72}{71}$ .

The formula holds here. Let’s try another case, say $n = 8$ (factors 1, 2, 4, 8):

- Sum: $1 + 2 + 4 + 8 = 15 \neq 72$ , so this doesn’t fit, but let’s compute anyway:
- Reciprocals: $\frac{1}{1} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{8} = 1 + 0.5 + 0.25 + 0.125 = 1.875$ .
- $\frac{15}{8} = 1.875$ , consistent with the pattern, though the sum isn’t 72.

The key is that whenever $\sum d_i = 72$ , the formula $\frac{72}{n}$ applies.

### Step 6: Checking Other Options

- **Option (A) $\frac{k^2}{72}$**: $k$ is the number of factors. For $n = 71$ , $k = 2$ , so $\frac{2^2}{72} = \frac{4}{72} = \frac{1}{18} \neq \frac{72}{71}$ .
- **Option (B) $\frac{72}{k}$**: $\frac{72}{2} = 36 \neq \frac{72}{71}$ .
- **Option (D)**: We’ve computed it, so it’s not indeterminable.

Only (C) consistently matches our derivation.

### Final Answer

The value of $\frac{1}{d_1} + \frac{1}{d_2} + \ldots + \frac{1}{d_k}$ is $\frac{72}{n}$ , corresponding to option (C).

No response.

Interrupted i thought option D, because maybe negative divisors, how could I have avoided going that route

When solving problems about the divisors of a positive integer $n$ , it’s understandable that you might have considered option D due to the possibility of negative divisors. However, the correct answer is option C, and here’s how you can avoid that mistake in the future.

In number theory, when we talk about the divisors of a positive integer $n$ , we typically mean the **positive divisors** —the positive integers that divide $n$ evenly, including 1 and $n$ itself. This is a standard convention unless the problem explicitly states otherwise. In this case, the problem mentions "all the factors of a positive integer $n$ , including 1 and $n$ itself," and their sum is given as 72. This strongly suggests we’re dealing with positive divisors only, leading to the sum of divisors function $\sigma(n) = 72$ .

### Why Negative Divisors Don’t Fit

You might have wondered if negative divisors (like $-1$ , $-2$ , etc.) should be included. Let’s explore why that doesn’t work here:

- **Sum of Divisors**: If we included negative divisors, each positive divisor $d$ would have a counterpart $-d$ . Their contributions would cancel out: $d + (-d) = 0$ . For any $n > 1$ , the total sum of all divisors (positive and negative) would be zero. But the problem states the sum is 72, a positive number, so negative divisors can’t be part of the calculation.
- **Sum of Reciprocals**: Similarly, if negative divisors were considered, the sum of reciprocals would include terms like $\frac{1}{d} + \frac{1}{-d} = \frac{1}{d} - \frac{1}{d} = 0$ for each pair. This would result in a total sum of zero, which doesn’t align with the problem’s context, where we expect a positive value (as implied by the options).

### How to Avoid the Mistake

To steer clear of considering negative divisors next time, keep these strategies in mind:

1. **Stick to Standard Definitions**: Unless the problem explicitly mentions negative divisors, assume divisors are positive. This is the default in most number theory problems involving sums like $\sigma(n)$ or sums of reciprocals.
2. **Check the Given Information**: The sum of divisors is 72, a positive value. If negative divisors were included, the sum would be zero for $n > 1$ , which contradicts the problem. This is a clue to focus on positive divisors only.
3. **Test with an Example**: Consider a small number like $n = 6$ . Its positive divisors are 1, 2, 3, 6, with a sum of $1 + 2 + 3 + 6 = 12$ . The sum of their reciprocals is:
	$$
	\frac{1}{1} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{6} = 1 + 0.5 + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{6} = \frac{6}{6} + \frac{3}{6} + \frac{2}{6} + \frac{1}{6} = \frac{12}{6} = 2
	$$
	 This matches $\frac{\sigma(n)}{n} = \frac{12}{6} = 2$ . If we included negative divisors ( $-1$ , $-2$ , $-3$ , $-6$ ), the sum of divisors would be 0, and the sum of reciprocals would also be 0, which doesn’t fit.
4. **Interpret the Problem’s Language**: Phrases like "factors of a positive integer" and the inclusion of "1 and $n$ itself" (both positive) reinforce that we’re working with positive divisors.

### Connecting to the Answer

The problem likely asked for the sum of the reciprocals of the divisors of $n$ , given $\sigma(n) = 72$ . For a positive integer $n$ with positive divisors $d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_k$ , the sum of reciprocals is:

$$
\frac{1}{d_1} + \frac{1}{d_2} + \cdots + \frac{1}{d_k} = \frac{\sigma(n)}{n}
$$

Here, $\sigma(n) = 72$ , so the sum is $\frac{72}{n}$ , which corresponds to option C. Option D probably represented a different expression, perhaps altered by the misconception of negative divisors.

By focusing on the standard meaning of divisors, verifying with the given sum, and using examples, you can confidently avoid detours like negative divisors and arrive at the correct solution. https://grok.com/chat/ed14237b-b9cb-43f5-8a92-1168858d922c
