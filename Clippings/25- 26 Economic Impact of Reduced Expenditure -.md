To determine the impact on the equilibrium price $p$  when Country A reduces its expenditure from 100 to 70, we need to analyze the given economic scenario involving two countries, A and B, producing wheat and television, respectively. Let’s break this down step-by-step using the provided data and preferences.

### Step 1: Understand the Setup

- **Countries and Production**:
	- Country A produces only wheat, with output $Y_A = 200$  .
	- Country B produces only television, with output $Y_B = 250$  .
- **Prices**:
	- Television is the numeraire, so its price is 1.
	- The price of wheat is $p$  (in terms of television).
- **Expenditures**:
	- Country A’s total expenditure, measured in wheat, is $E_A$  .
	- Country B’s total expenditure, measured in television, is $E_B$  .
	- Initially, $E_A = 100$  , and it reduces to $E_A = 70$  .
- **Economic Constraint**:
	- Total world income equals total world expenditure:  
		$p Y_A + Y_B = p E_A + E_B$  .
- **Preferences**:
	- Residents of both countries spend 1/3 of their expenditure on wheat and 2/3 on television.
- **Trade Balance**:
	- Country A’s trade balance (in wheat) is $T_A = Y_A - E_A$  .
- **Objective**:
	- Find how $p$  changes when $E_A$  decreases from 100 to 70, while markets clear (wheat consumed equals $Y_A$  , television consumed equals $Y_B$  ).

### Step 2: Define Expenditures and Consumption

Since $E_A$  is in wheat, Country A’s total expenditure in television (the numeraire) is $p E_A$  , as each unit of wheat is worth $p$  television. Similarly, $E_B$  is already in television.

For Country A:

- Total expenditure in television: $p E_A$  .
- Preference: 1/3 on wheat, 2/3 on television.
- Wheat consumption $C_A^w$  : Expenditure on wheat is $p C_A^w = \frac{1}{3} p E_A$  , so: $C_A^w = \frac{1}{3} E_A$  .
- Television consumption $C_A^t$  : Expenditure on television is $C_A^t = \frac{2}{3} p E_A$  .

Check: Total expenditure $p C_A^w + C_A^t = \frac{1}{3} p E_A + \frac{2}{3} p E_A = p E_A$  , which holds.

For Country B:

- Total expenditure in television: $E_B$  .
- Preference: 1/3 on wheat, 2/3 on television.
- Wheat consumption $C_B^w$  : $p C_B^w = \frac{1}{3} E_B$  , so: $C_B^w = \frac{1}{3} \frac{E_B}{p}$  .
- Television consumption $C_B^t$  : $C_B^t = \frac{2}{3} E_B$  .

Check: $p C_B^w + C_B^t = \frac{1}{3} E_B + \frac{2}{3} E_B = E_B$  , which holds.

### Step 3: Market Clearing Conditions

- **Wheat market**: Total consumption equals production: $C_A^w + C_B^w = Y_A$  $\frac{1}{3} E_A + \frac{1}{3} \frac{E_B}{p} = 200$
- **Television market**: Total consumption equals production: $C_A^t + C_B^t = Y_B$  $\frac{2}{3} p E_A + \frac{2}{3} E_B = 250$
- **World income-expenditure balance**: $p Y_A + Y_B = p E_A + E_B$  $p \cdot 200 + 250 = p E_A + E_B$

### Step 4: Solve the System

From the wheat market: $\frac{1}{3} E_A + \frac{1}{3} \frac{E_B}{p} = 200$  Multiply by 3: $E_A + \frac{E_B}{p} = 600 \quad (1)$

From the television market: $\frac{2}{3} p E_A + \frac{2}{3} E_B = 250$  Multiply by $\frac{3}{2}$  : $p E_A + E_B = 375 \quad (2)$

From the income-expenditure equation: $200p + 250 = p E_A + E_B \quad (3)$

**Substitute $E_B$  from (2) into (1)**: $E_B = 375 - p E_A$  $E_A + \frac{375 - p E_A}{p} = 600$  Multiply by $p$  : $p E_A + (375 - p E_A) = 600p$  $375 = 600p$  $p = \frac{375}{600} = \frac{5}{8}$

**Verify with (3)**: Left side: $200 \cdot \frac{5}{8} + 250 = 125 + 250 = 375$  Right side: $p E_A + E_B$  , which equals 375 from (2), so it holds.

### Step 5: Test with Initial and New EA E\_A

- **Initial $E_A = 100$** : $E_B = 375 - p \cdot 100 = 375 - \frac{5}{8} \cdot 100 = 375 - 62.5 = 312.5$ 
	- Wheat: $\frac{1}{3} \cdot 100 + \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{312.5}{\frac{5}{8}} = \frac{100}{3} + \frac{1}{3} \cdot 312.5 \cdot \frac{8}{5} = \frac{100}{3} + \frac{1}{3} \cdot 500 = \frac{100}{3} + \frac{500}{3} = 200$
	- Television: $\frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{5}{8} \cdot 100 + \frac{2}{3} \cdot 312.5 = \frac{2}{3} \cdot 62.5 + \frac{2}{3} \cdot 312.5 = \frac{125}{3} + \frac{625}{3} = \frac{750}{3} = 250$  Markets clear.
- **New $E_A = 70$** : $E_B = 375 - \frac{5}{8} \cdot 70 = 375 - 43.75 = 331.25$ 
	- Wheat: $\frac{1}{3} \cdot 70 + \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{331.25}{\frac{5}{8}} = \frac{70}{3} + \frac{1}{3} \cdot 331.25 \cdot \frac{8}{5} = \frac{70}{3} + \frac{1}{3} \cdot 530 = \frac{70}{3} + \frac{530}{3} = 200$
	- Television: $\frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{5}{8} \cdot 70 + \frac{2}{3} \cdot 331.25 = \frac{2}{3} \cdot 43.75 + \frac{2}{3} \cdot 331.25 = \frac{87.5}{3} + \frac{662.5}{3} = \frac{750}{3} = 250$  Markets clear.

### Step 6: Interpret the Result

Remarkably, $p = \frac{5}{8}$  holds for both $E_A = 100$  and $E_A = 70$  . The equilibrium price depends on the production ratio and preferences ( $p = \frac{Y_B}{2 Y_A} = \frac{250}{400} = \frac{5}{8}$  ), and $E_B$  adjusts to maintain market clearing. Thus, reducing $E_A$  increases A’s trade surplus ( $T_A = 200 - 70 = 130$  vs. $100$  ), but $p$  remains unchanged.

### Final Answer

The equilibrium price $p$  will stay the same.

what are the adjoining concepts and theories and equations that are important to learn for the ISI MSQE paper in relation to the above question

25 web pages

To effectively prepare for the ISI MSQE (Indian Statistical Institute Master of Science in Quantitative Economics) entrance exam in relation to the question about the impact on equilibrium price when a country reduces its expenditure, it’s essential to understand the adjoining concepts, theories, and equations rooted in international trade and microeconomic theory. The problem involves two countries trading goods (wheat and television), with given production outputs, expenditure changes, and consumption preferences, and uses television as the numeraire. Below, I outline the key areas to focus on, ensuring a comprehensive and self-contained explanation.

---

### 1\. International Trade Theory

The problem is set in the context of international trade, where countries specialize in producing specific goods and trade based on economic incentives. Key theories include:

- **Comparative Advantage**: Originating from David Ricardo, this theory explains how countries benefit from trade by specializing in goods they produce at a lower opportunity cost. While the problem specifies that Country A produces only wheat and Country B produces only television, understanding comparative advantage provides the foundation for why trade occurs and how prices adjust.
- **Absolute Advantage**: Since each country produces just one good, absolute advantage (producing more efficiently) may also apply, though the focus is on trade equilibrium rather than specialization decisions.
- **Terms of Trade**: This refers to the relative price of exports to imports (here, the price of wheat in terms of television, denoted as $p$  ). Changes in expenditure affect demand and, potentially, this price, making it central to the problem.

**Why It’s Important**: The equilibrium price $p$  reflects the terms of trade, and understanding these theories helps analyze how expenditure shifts influence trade balances and prices.

---

### 2\. Market Equilibrium and Clearing Conditions

The problem requires the wheat and television markets to clear, meaning total supply equals total demand for each good. This is a cornerstone of microeconomics and trade models.

- **Wheat Market Clearing**: Total wheat consumed by both countries must equal total wheat produced (e.g., $Y_A = 200$  ).
- **Television Market Clearing**: Total television consumed must equal total television produced (e.g., $Y_B = 250$  ).
- **Equations**:
	- For wheat: $\text{Demand for wheat} = \text{Supply of wheat}$
	- For television: $\text{Demand for television} = \text{Supply of television}$

Given preferences (1/3 of expenditure on wheat, 2/3 on television), demand depends on expenditures and the price $p$  . For example:

- Country A’s wheat consumption: $\frac{1}{3} E_A$  (since $E_A$  is in wheat units).
- Country B’s wheat consumption: $\frac{1}{3} \frac{E_B}{p}$  (since $E_B$  is in television units, and wheat’s price is $p$  ).

**Why It’s Important**: Solving these equations determines $p$  , and understanding how expenditure changes affect demand is key to assessing price impacts.

---

### 3\. Numeraire and Price Normalization

In the problem, television is the numeraire, meaning its price is fixed at 1, and the price of wheat ( $p$  ) is measured in terms of television. This simplifies calculations by providing a common unit of value.

- **Concept**: A numeraire eliminates the need for a separate currency by setting one good’s price as the reference (here, television = 1).
- **Implication**: All values (income, expenditure) are expressed in television units, so wheat quantities are multiplied by $p$  to convert them.

**Equations**:

- Country A’s total expenditure in television: $p E_A$  .
- Country B’s expenditure: $E_B$  (already in television).

**Why It’s Important**: Misinterpreting units can lead to errors. The numeraire ensures consistency in solving for $p$  .

---

### 4\. Budget Constraints and Preferences

The problem specifies that residents of both countries spend 1/3 of their expenditure on wheat and 2/3 on television. This reflects utility maximization subject to a budget constraint.

- **Budget Constraint**:
	- For Country A: $p \times \text{Wheat consumed} + \text{Television consumed} = p E_A$  .
	- For Country B: $p \times \text{Wheat consumed} + \text{Television consumed} = E_B$  .
- **Preferences**: A Cobb-Douglas utility function like $U = W^{1/3} T^{2/3}$  (where $W$  is wheat, $T$  is television) could generate these expenditure shares, as consumers allocate income proportionally.

**Equations**:

- Country A’s wheat demand: $\frac{1}{3} E_A$  .
- Country B’s wheat demand: $\frac{1}{3} \frac{E_B}{p}$  .
- Television demands follow similarly.

**Why It’s Important**: Preferences drive demand, and changes in expenditure (e.g., $E_A$  dropping from 100 to 70) shift demand, potentially affecting $p$  .

---

### 5\. World Income-Expenditure Balance

The problem provides the constraint $p Y_A + Y_B = p E_A + E_B$  , ensuring total world income equals total expenditure in equilibrium.

- **Income**:
	- Country A: $p Y_A$  (wheat output valued in television).
	- Country B: $Y_B$  (television output).
- **Expenditure**:
	- Country A: $p E_A$  .
	- Country B: $E_B$  .

**Equation**: $p \times 200 + 250 = p E_A + E_B$  .

**Why It’s Important**: This links production and consumption globally, allowing $E_B$  to adjust when $E_A$  changes, stabilizing $p$  .

---

### 6\. Trade Balance

While not explicitly required, trade balance concepts help interpret results.

- **Country A’s Trade Balance**: $T_A = Y_A - E_A$  (net wheat exports).
- **Value in Television**: $p T_A$  .
- **Country B**: Imports wheat, exports television.

**Why It’s Important**: Expenditure reduction increases exports, but in this model, $p$  remains constant due to market clearing and income balance.

---

### 7\. Key Equations to Solve

Combining the above:

1. **Wheat Market**: $\frac{1}{3} E_A + \frac{1}{3} \frac{E_B}{p} = 200$  .
2. **Television Market**: $\frac{2}{3} p E_A + \frac{2}{3} E_B = 250$  .
3. **Income-Expenditure**: $p \times 200 + 250 = p E_A + E_B$  .

Solving these shows $p = \frac{5}{8}$  consistently, as $E_B$  adjusts (e.g., from 312.5 to 331.25 when $E_A$  drops from 100 to 70).

To determine the impact on the equilibrium price $p$  when Country A reduces its expenditure from 100 to 70, we need to analyze the economic scenario involving two countries, A and B, producing wheat and television, respectively, with specific production outputs, expenditure preferences, and market-clearing conditions. Let’s proceed step-by-step to find the effect on $p$  , the relative price of wheat in terms of television.

---

### Step 1: Define the Economic Framework

- **Production**:
	- Country A produces only wheat: $Y_A = 200$  .
	- Country B produces only television: $Y_B = 250$  .
- **Prices**:
	- Television is the numeraire, so its price is 1.
	- The price of wheat is $p$  (in terms of television).
- **Expenditures**:
	- Country A’s expenditure, $E_A$  , is measured in wheat, so its value in television is $p E_A$  .
	- Country B’s expenditure, $E_B$  , is measured in television.
	- Initially, $E_A = 100$  , and it reduces to $E_A = 70$  .
- **Preferences**:
	- Residents of both countries spend 1/3 of their expenditure on wheat and 2/3 on television.
- **Market Clearing**:
	- Wheat consumed globally equals $Y_A = 200$  .
	- Television consumed globally equals $Y_B = 250$  .
- **World Income-Expenditure Balance**:
	- Total world income equals total world expenditure:
		$$
		p Y_A + Y_B = p E_A + E_B
		$$
		 Substituting known values:
		$$
		200p + 250 = p E_A + E_B
		$$

Our goal is to find how $p$  changes when $E_A$  decreases from 100 to 70, ensuring all markets clear.

---

### Step 2: Express Consumption Based on Preferences

#### Country A:

- Total expenditure in television: $p E_A$  .
- **Wheat consumption ( $C_A^w$  )**:
	- Expenditure on wheat: $p C_A^w = \frac{1}{3} p E_A$  .
	- Thus:
		$$
		C_A^w = \frac{1}{3} E_A
		$$
- **Television consumption ( $C_A^t$  )**:
	- Expenditure on television: $C_A^t = \frac{2}{3} p E_A$  .
	- So:
		$$
		C_A^t = \frac{2}{3} p E_A
		$$
- Check: $p C_A^w + C_A^t = \frac{1}{3} p E_A + \frac{2}{3} p E_A = p E_A$  , which is consistent.

#### Country B:

- Total expenditure in television: $E_B$  .
- **Wheat consumption ( $C_B^w$  )**:
	- Expenditure on wheat: $p C_B^w = \frac{1}{3} E_B$  .
	- Thus:
		$$
		C_B^w = \frac{1}{3} \frac{E_B}{p}
		$$
- **Television consumption ( $C_B^t$  )**:
	- Expenditure on television: $C_B^t = \frac{2}{3} E_B$  .
	- So:
		$$
		C_B^t = \frac{2}{3} E_B
		$$
- Check: $p C_B^w + C_B^t = \frac{1}{3} E_B + \frac{2}{3} E_B = E_B$  , which holds.

---

### Step 3: Set Up Market-Clearing Conditions

- **Wheat Market**:
	$$
	C_A^w + C_B^w = Y_A
	$$
	 
	$$
	\frac{1}{3} E_A + \frac{1}{3} \frac{E_B}{p} = 200
	$$
	 Multiply by 3:
	$$
	E_A + \frac{E_B}{p} = 600 \quad (1)
	$$
- **Television Market**:
	$$
	C_A^t + C_B^t = Y_B
	$$
	 
	$$
	\frac{2}{3} p E_A + \frac{2}{3} E_B = 250
	$$
	 Multiply by $\frac{3}{2}$  :
	$$
	p E_A + E_B = 375 \quad (2)
	$$
- **Income-Expenditure Balance**:
	$$
	200p + 250 = p E_A + E_B \quad (3)
	$$

---

### Step 4: Solve the System

From equation (2):

$$
E_B = 375 - p E_A
$$

Substitute into equation (1):

$$
E_A + \frac{375 - p E_A}{p} = 600
$$

Multiply through by $p$  :

$$
p E_A + (375 - p E_A) = 600p
$$

Simplify:

$$
375 = 600p
$$
 
$$
p = \frac{375}{600} = \frac{5}{8}
$$

Check consistency with equation (3):

- Left side: $200 \cdot \frac{5}{8} + 250 = 125 + 250 = 375$  .
- Right side: $p E_A + E_B = 375$  (from equation (2)), which matches.

---

### Step 5: Evaluate Initial and New Scenarios

- **Initial Case ( $E_A = 100$  )**:
	- $E_B = 375 - \frac{5}{8} \cdot 100 = 375 - 62.5 = 312.5$  .
	- Wheat: $\frac{1}{3} \cdot 100 + \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{312.5}{\frac{5}{8}} = \frac{100}{3} + \frac{1}{3} \cdot 500 = \frac{100}{3} + \frac{500}{3} = 200$  .
	- Television: $\frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{5}{8} \cdot 100 + \frac{2}{3} \cdot 312.5 = \frac{125}{3} + \frac{625}{3} = 250$  .
	- Both markets clear at $p = \frac{5}{8}$  .
- **New Case ( $E_A = 70$  )**:
	- $E_B = 375 - \frac{5}{8} \cdot 70 = 375 - 43.75 = 331.25$  .
	- Wheat: $\frac{1}{3} \cdot 70 + \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{331.25}{\frac{5}{8}} = \frac{70}{3} + \frac{1}{3} \cdot 530 = \frac{70}{3} + \frac{530}{3} = 200$  .
	- Television: $\frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{5}{8} \cdot 70 + \frac{2}{3} \cdot 331.25 = \frac{87.5}{3} + \frac{662.5}{3} = 250$  .
	- Both markets clear at $p = \frac{5}{8}$  .

---

### Step 6: Conclusion

The equilibrium price $p = \frac{5}{8}$  remains the same whether $E_A = 100$  or $E_A = 70$  . This stability arises because $p$  is determined by the ratio of total production and the fixed expenditure shares (1/3 on wheat, 2/3 on television), while $E_B$  adjusts to maintain market clearing. Specifically, $p = \frac{Y_B}{2 Y_A} = \frac{250}{400} = \frac{5}{8}$  , independent of $E_A$  . The reduction in $E_A$  increases Country A’s trade surplus ( $T_A = 200 - 70 = 130$  vs. 100), but does not alter $p$  .

Thus, the impact on the equilibrium price $p$  is:

**(A) $p$  will stay the same**

Refer to the following content:image.png

Let’s dive into this economics problem involving two countries, A and B, and determine how a reduction in Country A’s expenditure affects the equilibrium price of wheat in terms of television. Country A produces only wheat with an output of 200 units, while Country B produces only television with an output of 250 units. Television is the numeraire, so its price is fixed at 1, and the price of wheat is denoted by $p$  . The total expenditure of Country A, measured in wheat, is $E_A$  , and for Country B, it’s $E_B$  in television units. Initially, $E_A = 100$  , and it reduces to 70. The preference structure specifies that residents of each country spend 1/3 of their expenditure on their own good and 2/3 on the other good. Our goal is to find the impact on the equilibrium price $p$  .

### Step 1: Define Expenditures and Preferences

Since $E_A$  is in wheat units, Country A’s total expenditure in television units (the numeraire) is $p E_A$  . Country B’s expenditure is already in television units, so it’s simply $E_B$  .

- **Country A’s preferences**:
	- Own good (wheat): Spends 1/3 of $p E_A$  on wheat.
	- Other good (television): Spends 2/3 of $p E_A$  on television.
	- Wheat consumption: Expenditure on wheat is $\frac{1}{3} p E_A$  , and since the price of wheat is $p$  , quantity consumed is $\frac{\frac{1}{3} p E_A}{p} = \frac{1}{3} E_A$  .
	- Television consumption: Expenditure is $\frac{2}{3} p E_A$  , and since the price of television is 1, quantity is $\frac{2}{3} p E_A$  .
- **Country B’s preferences**:
	- Own good (television): Spends 1/3 of $E_B$  on television.
	- Other good (wheat): Spends 2/3 of $E_B$  on wheat.
	- Television consumption: Expenditure is $\frac{1}{3} E_B$  , so quantity is $\frac{1}{3} E_B$  .
	- Wheat consumption: Expenditure is $\frac{2}{3} E_B$  , so quantity is $\frac{\frac{2}{3} E_B}{p} = \frac{2}{3} \frac{E_B}{p}$  .

### Step 2: Set Up Market Clearing Conditions

For equilibrium, the total consumption of each good must equal its total output.

- **Wheat market**:
	$$
	C_A^w + C_B^w = Y_A
	$$
	 
	$$
	\frac{1}{3} E_A + \frac{2}{3} \frac{E_B}{p} = 200
	$$
- **Television market**:
	$$
	C_A^t + C_B^t = Y_B
	$$
	 
	$$
	\frac{2}{3} p E_A + \frac{1}{3} E_B = 250
	$$

### Step 3: Income-Expenditure Balance

Total world income must equal total expenditure:

$$
p Y_A + Y_B = p E_A + E_B
$$
 
$$
p \cdot 200 + 250 = p E_A + E_B
$$
 
$$
200 p + 250 = p E_A + E_B
$$

### Step 4: Solve the System

We have three equations:

1. $\frac{1}{3} E_A + \frac{2}{3} \frac{E_B}{p} = 200$
2. $\frac{2}{3} p E_A + \frac{1}{3} E_B = 250$
3. $p E_A + E_B = 200 p + 250$

Let’s solve for $p$  as a function of $E_A$  .

- From equation 3:
	$$
	E_B = 200 p + 250 - p E_A
	$$
- Substitute into equation 2:
	$$
	\frac{2}{3} p E_A + \frac{1}{3} (200 p + 250 - p E_A) = 250
	$$
	 Multiply by 3:
	$$
	2 p E_A + 200 p + 250 - p E_A = 750
	$$
	 
	$$
	p E_A + 200 p + 250 = 750
	$$
	 
	$$
	p E_A + 200 p = 500
	$$
	 
	$$
	p (E_A + 200) = 500
	$$
	 
	$$
	p = \frac{500}{E_A + 200}
	$$

This gives us $p$  in terms of $E_A$  . Let’s verify with the wheat market (equation 1) later, but first, test the effect of changing $E_A$  .

### Step 5: Evaluate the Change in p p

- When $E_A = 100$  :
	$$
	p = \frac{500}{100 + 200} = \frac{500}{300} = \frac{5}{3} \approx 1.6667
	$$
- When $E_A = 70$  :
	$$
	p = \frac{500}{70 + 200} = \frac{500}{270} = \frac{50}{27} \approx 1.8519
	$$

Since $\frac{50}{27} > \frac{5}{3}$  (1.8519 > 1.6667), $p$  increases when $E_A$  decreases from 100 to 70.

### Step 6: Verify Consistency

Let’s compute $E_B$  and check both markets.

- For $E_A = 100$  , $p = \frac{5}{3}$  :
	$$
	E_B = 200 \cdot \frac{5}{3} + 250 - \frac{5}{3} \cdot 100 = \frac{1000}{3} + 250 - \frac{500}{3} = \frac{1000 + 750 - 500}{3} = \frac{1250}{3}
	$$
	- Wheat: $\frac{1}{3} \cdot 100 + \frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{\frac{1250}{3}}{\frac{5}{3}} = \frac{100}{3} + \frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{1250}{3} \cdot \frac{3}{5} = \frac{100}{3} + \frac{2}{3} \cdot 250 = \frac{100}{3} + \frac{500}{3} = 200$
	- Television: $\frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{5}{3} \cdot 100 + \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1250}{3} = \frac{1000}{9} + \frac{1250}{9} = \frac{2250}{9} = 250$  Both markets clear.
- For $E_A = 70$  , $p = \frac{50}{27}$  :
	$$
	E_B = 200 \cdot \frac{50}{27} + 250 - \frac{50}{27} \cdot 70 = \frac{10000}{27} + \frac{6750}{27} - \frac{3500}{27} = \frac{13250}{27}
	$$
	- Wheat: $\frac{1}{3} \cdot 70 + \frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{\frac{13250}{27}}{\frac{50}{27}} = \frac{70}{3} + \frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{13250}{27} \cdot \frac{27}{50} = \frac{70}{3} + \frac{2}{3} \cdot 265 = \frac{70 + 530}{3} = 200$
	- Television: $\frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{50}{27} \cdot 70 + \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{13250}{27} = \frac{7000}{81} + \frac{13250}{81} = \frac{20250}{81} = 250$  Both markets clear.

The solution is consistent.

### Step 7: Interpret the Result

When $E_A$  decreases, the denominator in $p = \frac{500}{E_A + 200}$  decreases, causing $p$  to increase. Intuitively, reducing $E_A$  lowers Country A’s demand for television more (2/3 share) than wheat (1/3 share), and since Country A supplies wheat, the relative price of wheat rises to balance the markets.

### Final Answer

The equilibrium price $p$  will increase when Country A reduces its expenditure from 100 to 70. Thus, the answer is (B). https://grok.com/chat/8b5b8f12-780a-4a11-8ec1-05ac43a13960
