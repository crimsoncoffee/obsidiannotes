Refer to the following content:image.png

Let’s solve this problem step-by-step. We’re given a function $f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$  that is differentiable, with its derivative $f'(x)$  being strictly increasing in $x$  . Additionally, we know $f\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = \frac{1}{2}$  and $f(1) = 1$  . Our task is to determine which of the following statements about $f'(x)$  is true:

- (a) $f'\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) < 1 < f'(1)$
- (b) $f'\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) < f'(1) < 1$
- (c) $1 < f'\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) < f'(1)$
- (d) None of the above

---

### Step 1: Understand the Given Conditions

Since $f$  is differentiable and $f'(x)$  is strictly increasing, for any $x_1 < x_2$  , we have $f'(x_1) < f'(x_2)$  . This property suggests that the function $f$  is strictly convex (if it were twice differentiable, we’d expect $f''(x) > 0$  , but we don’t need to assume twice differentiability here). We’re also given two specific points:

- $f\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = \frac{1}{2}$
- $f(1) = 1$

These points will help us analyze the behavior of $f'(x)$  over the interval $\left[\frac{1}{2}, 1\right]$ .

---

### Step 2: Apply the Mean Value Theorem

Since $f$  is differentiable on $\mathbb{R}$ , it is continuous on $\left[\frac{1}{2}, 1\right]$ and differentiable on $\left(\frac{1}{2}, 1\right)$ . By the Mean Value Theorem, there exists some $c$  in $\left(\frac{1}{2}, 1\right)$ such that:

$$
f'(c) = \frac{f(1) - f\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)}{1 - \frac{1}{2}}
$$

Calculate the difference:

$$
f(1) - f\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = 1 - \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2}
$$

And the denominator:

$$
1 - \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2}
$$

So:

$$
f'(c) = \frac{\frac{1}{2}}{\frac{1}{2}} = 1
$$

Thus, there exists a point $c$  where $\frac{1}{2} < c < 1$ such that $f'(c) = 1$  .

---

### Step 3: Use the Strictly Increasing Property of f′(x) f'(x)

Since $f'(x)$  is strictly increasing, if $x_1 < x_2$  , then $f'(x_1) < f'(x_2)$  . Given that $f'(c) = 1$  at some $c$  in $\left(\frac{1}{2}, 1\right)$ , we can compare $f'(x)$  at different points relative to $c$  :

- For $x < c$  , $f'(x) < f'(c) = 1$
- For $x > c$  , $f'(x) > f'(c) = 1$

Now, consider the points of interest:

- At $x = \frac{1}{2}$  , since $\frac{1}{2} < c$ (because $c > \frac{1}{2}$  ), we have:
	$$
	f'\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) < f'(c) = 1
	$$
- At $x = 1$  , since $c < 1$  (because $c < 1$  ), we have:
	$$
	f'(1) > f'(c) = 1
	$$

Additionally, since $\frac{1}{2} < 1$ , and $f'(x)$  is strictly increasing:

$$
f'\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) < f'(1)
$$

Combining these inequalities:

$$
f'\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) < 1 < f'(1)
$$

This matches option (a). Let’s verify by checking the other options.

---

### Step 4: Evaluate the Options

- **Option (a): $f'\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) < 1 < f'(1)$**  
	From our analysis, this holds true: $f'\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) < 1$  (since $\frac{1}{2} < c$ ) and $f'(1) > 1$  (since $1 > c$  ).
- **Option (b): $f'\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) < f'(1) < 1$**  
	While $f'\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) < f'(1)$  is true due to $f'(x)$  being strictly increasing, we found $f'(1) > 1$  . Thus, $f'(1) < 1$  cannot hold, so this option is false.
- **Option (c): $1 < f'\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) < f'(1)$**  
	We determined that $f'\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) < 1$  , so $1 < f'\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)$  is false. This option is incorrect.
- **Option (d): None of the above**  
	Since option (a) appears to be true, this option would only be correct if (a), (b), and (c) were all false. We need to confirm (a) holds universally.

---

### Step 5: Confirm with an Example (Optional Robustness Check)

Consider a function that satisfies all conditions, e.g., $f(x) = x^2 - \frac{1}{2}x + \frac{1}{2}$  :

- $f'(x) = 2x - \frac{1}{2}$  , which is strictly increasing (since the coefficient 2 is positive).
- Check: $f\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 - \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2}$
- Check: $f(1) = 1 - \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = 1$
- Derivatives:
	- $f'\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{2} = 1 - \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2} < 1$
	- $f'(1) = 2 \cdot 1 - \frac{1}{2} = 2 - \frac{1}{2} = \frac{3}{2} > 1$

This satisfies $f'\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = \frac{1}{2} < 1 < \frac{3}{2} = f'(1)$  , supporting option (a).

---

### Step 6: Final Verification

Could $f'\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) \geq 1$  or $f'(1) \leq 1$  ?

- If $f'\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = 1$  , then for $x > \frac{1}{2}$  , $f'(x) > 1$  (since $f'$  is strictly increasing). But $f(1) - f\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = \frac{1}{2}$  , and if $f'(x) > 1$  on $\left(\frac{1}{2}, 1\right)$ , the increase would exceed $\frac{1}{2}$ , contradicting the Mean Value Theorem’s $f'(c) = 1$  . Thus, $f'\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) < 1$  .
- If $f'(1) \leq 1$  , since $f'(c) = 1$  at $c < 1$  and $f'$  is strictly increasing, $f'(1) > 1$  . This contradiction means $f'(1) > 1$  .

Thus, $f'\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) < 1 < f'(1)$  holds in all cases.

---

### Conclusion

The correct answer is option (a): $f'\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) < 1 < f'(1)$  .

what other properties can we ascribe here that i should know and keep in mind

Let’s explore the properties of the function $f(x)$  based on the given information: $f'(x)$  is strictly increasing, $f\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = \frac{1}{2}$  , and $f(1) = 1$  . Since the query asks for properties to know and keep in mind, I’ll focus on key characteristics that describe the function’s behavior, particularly over the interval $\left[\frac{1}{2}, 1\right]$ , while also considering its global behavior where relevant. These properties stem from the strict increase of the derivative and the specific values provided.

### 1\. Strict Convexity

Since $f'(x)$  is strictly increasing, $f(x)$  is **strictly convex** over its entire domain (assumed to be all real numbers unless otherwise specified). This means:

- The graph of $f(x)$  always curves upward.
- For any two points $x_1 < x_2$  and any $\lambda \in (0, 1)$  , the function satisfies the strict inequality:
	$$
	f(\lambda x_1 + (1 - \lambda) x_2) < \lambda f(x_1) + (1 - \lambda) f(x_2).
	$$
- Geometrically, any point on the graph between $x_1$  and $x_2$  lies strictly below the line segment (chord) connecting $(x_1, f(x_1))$  and $(x_2, f(x_2))$  .

This property is fundamental because it governs the shape of the function and influences many of its other characteristics.

### 2\. Behavior Relative to the Line y=x y = x

Given $f\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = \frac{1}{2}$  and $f(1) = 1$  , both points lie on the line $y = x$  . The secant line connecting these points is:

$$
y = x,
$$

since the slope is:

$$
\frac{f(1) - f\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)}{1 - \frac{1}{2}} = \frac{1 - \frac{1}{2}}{1 - \frac{1}{2}} = 1,
$$

and it passes through the points correctly. Because $f(x)$  is strictly convex, for any $x \in \left(\frac{1}{2}, 1\right)$  :

$$
f(x) < x.
$$
- At the endpoints $x = \frac{1}{2}$  and $x = 1$  , $f(x) = x$  .
- Between these points, the function dips below the line $y = x$  , reflecting its upward curvature.

This is a key property over the interval $\left[\frac{1}{2}, 1\right]$ , showing that $f(x)$  grows more slowly than $y = x$  within this open interval.

### 3\. Derivative Behavior and the Mean Value Theorem

Since $f'(x)$  is strictly increasing:

- $f'(x_1) < f'(x_2)$  whenever $x_1 < x_2$  .
- By the Mean Value Theorem, there exists some $c \in \left(\frac{1}{2}, 1\right)$  such that:
	$$
	f'(c) = \frac{f(1) - f\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)}{1 - \frac{1}{2}} = \frac{1 - \frac{1}{2}}{1 - \frac{1}{2}} = 1.
	$$
- Because $f'(x)$  is strictly increasing, $c$  is unique (if $f'(x) = 1$  at two points, the derivative would be constant between them, contradicting strict increase).
- For $x < c$  , $f'(x) < 1$  ; for $x > c$  , $f'(x) > 1$  .

This tells us:

- At $x = \frac{1}{2}$  , $f'\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) < 1$  (since $\frac{1}{2} < c$  ).
- At $x = 1$  , $f'(1) > 1$  (since $1 > c$  ).
- The slope transitions from less than 1 to greater than 1 at $x = c$  , indicating that $f(x)$  increases more slowly than $y = x$  before $c$  and more quickly after $c$  .

### 4\. Analysis of g(x)=f(x)−x g(x) = f(x) - x

Define $g(x) = f(x) - x$  . Then:

- $g'(x) = f'(x) - 1$  .
- Since $f'(x)$  is strictly increasing, $g'(x)$  is also strictly increasing.
- At $x = c$  where $f'(c) = 1$  , $g'(c) = 0$  .
- For $x < c$  , $g'(x) < 0$  ; for $x > c$  , $g'(x) > 0$  .

Thus, $g(x)$  has a minimum at $x = c$  . Evaluate $g(x)$  at the given points:

- $g\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = f\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) - \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{2} = 0$  ,
- $g(1) = f(1) - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0$  .

Since $g(x)$  is strictly convex (because $g'(x)$  is strictly increasing) and equals 0 at the endpoints of $\left[\frac{1}{2}, 1\right]$ , and has a minimum at $c \in \left(\frac{1}{2}, 1\right)$  :

- $g(c) < 0$  (if $g(c) \geq 0$  , strict convexity would be violated, as $g(x)$  must dip below the secant line $y = 0$  between the endpoints).
- For $x \in \left(\frac{1}{2}, 1\right)$  , $g(x) < 0$  , reinforcing that $f(x) < x$  in this interval.

This function $g(x)$  provides a useful way to visualize $f(x)$  ’s deviation from the line $y = x$  .

### 5\. No Linear Segments or Inflection Points (with Caveats)

- Since $f'(x)$  is strictly increasing, it is never constant over any interval, so $f(x)$  has **no linear segments**.
- If $f(x)$  is twice differentiable, then $f''(x) \geq 0$  (convexity), and since $f'(x)$  is strictly increasing, $f''(x) > 0$  wherever it exists, implying **no inflection points** (the concavity is always upward). However, without guaranteed twice differentiability, we rely on strict convexity instead.

### 6\. Global Behavior of the Derivative

Since $f'(x)$  is strictly increasing over all real numbers:

- As $x \to -\infty$  , $f'(x)$  approaches either $-\infty$ or a finite lower bound (e.g., a horizontal asymptote for the derivative), but remains less than any value it takes.
- As $x \to \infty$  , $f'(x)$  approaches $\infty$  or a finite upper bound, increasing without limit or up to that bound.

This suggests $f(x)$  may grow unbounded upward and could approach $-\infty$ or a finite limit downward, but the problem’s focus is on $\left[\frac{1}{2}, 1\right]$ , so this is supplementary.

### 7\. Average Rate of Change

For any $a < b$  , the average rate of change is:

$$
\frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a} = f'(d),
$$

for some $d \in (a, b)$  by the Mean Value Theorem. Since $f'(x)$  is strictly increasing:

$$
f'(a) < f'(d) < f'(b),
$$

so:

$$
f'(a) < \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a} < f'(b).
$$

In $\left[\frac{1}{2}, 1\right]$ :

$$
f'\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) < 1 < f'(1),
$$

consistent with the derivative crossing 1 at $c$  .

### Summary of Key Properties

Here are the properties to keep in mind:

- **Strictly Convex**: $f(x)$  curves upward, with points between any two lying below the connecting chord.
- **$f(x) < x$  for $x \in \left(\frac{1}{2}, 1\right)$** : The function lies below $y = x$  between the endpoints where it equals $x$  .
- **Derivative Transition**: $f'\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) < 1$  , $f'(c) = 1$  for some $c \in \left(\frac{1}{2}, 1\right)$  , and $f'(1) > 1$  .
- **Minimum of $g(x) = f(x) - x$** : $g(x) < 0$  in $\left(\frac{1}{2}, 1\right)$ , with a minimum at $c$  .
- **No Linear Segments**: $f'(x)$  is never constant.
- **Slope Bounds**: The average rate of change lies between the derivative values at the endpoints.

These properties fully characterize $f(x)$  ’s behavior in the given interval and provide a solid foundation for understanding its nature across its domain.

Other some properties that useful in questions like this

Based on the properties of a differentiable function $f$  where its derivative $f'$  is strictly increasing, and given specific values such as $f\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = \frac{1}{2}$  and $f(1) = 1$  , here are some useful properties that can help in tackling similar mathematical questions. These properties stem from the function’s characteristics and can be applied in various contexts like optimization, inequalities, or analyzing function behavior.

### 1\. Strict Convexity

- **Description**: Since $f'$  is strictly increasing, $f$  is strictly convex. This means that for any two points $x_1 < x_2$  and any $\lambda \in (0, 1)$  ,
	$$
	f(\lambda x_1 + (1 - \lambda) x_2) < \lambda f(x_1) + (1 - \lambda) f(x_2).
	$$
- **Usefulness**: Strict convexity ensures that the function lies above any secant line (except at the endpoints) and below any tangent line. This property is valuable for proving inequalities or determining that any local minimum is also a global minimum.

### 2\. Position Relative to y=x y = x

- **Description**: Given $f\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = \frac{1}{2}$  and $f(1) = 1$  , $f(x) = x$  at these points. Due to strict convexity, between $x = \frac{1}{2}$  and $x = 1$  , $f(x) < x$  for $x \in \left(\frac{1}{2}, 1\right)$  .
- **Usefulness**: This helps determine where the function lies relative to the line $y = x$  , which can be key in fixed-point analysis or when comparing $f(x)$  to linear functions.

### 3\. Unique Derivative Value

- **Description**: By the Mean Value Theorem, there exists a unique point $c \in \left(\frac{1}{2}, 1\right)$  where $f'(c) = \frac{f(1) - f\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)}{1 - \frac{1}{2}} = 1$  , because $f'$  is strictly increasing.
- **Usefulness**: This unique point separates regions where $f'(x) < 1$  and $f'(x) > 1$  , aiding in understanding the function’s rate of growth compared to linear functions.

### 4\. Tangent Line Property

- **Description**: At any point $x_0$  , the tangent line to $f$  at $x_0$  is given by $y = f(x_0) + f'(x_0)(x - x_0)$  , and due to strict convexity, $f(x) > f(x_0) + f'(x_0)(x - x_0)$  for all $x \neq x_0$  .
- **Usefulness**: This provides a linear lower bound for the function, which is useful for approximations or establishing inequalities.

### 5\. Positive Second Derivative (If Applicable)

- **Description**: If $f$  is twice differentiable, then $f''(x) > 0$  for all $x$  , reinforcing the strict convexity.
- **Usefulness**: The positive second derivative indicates increasing slope and upward curvature, which can be applied in optimization problems or to analyze the function’s shape.

### 6\. Integral Inequalities

- **Description**: For convex functions, the Hermite-Hadamard inequality holds:
	$$
	f\left(\frac{a + b}{2}\right) \leq \frac{1}{b - a} \int_{a}^{b} f(x) \, dx \leq \frac{f(a) + f(b)}{2}.
	$$
- **Usefulness**: This is helpful for estimating the value of integrals or the average value of the function over an interval.

### 7\. No Inflection Points

- **Description**: Since $f'$  is strictly increasing, if $f$  is twice differentiable, $f''(x) > 0$  , so the function is always concave up with no inflection points.
- **Usefulness**: This consistent curvature simplifies graphing or analyzing the function’s behavior over its domain.

### 8\. Bounding Average Rate of Change

- **Description**: For any $a < b$  , the average rate of change satisfies:
	$$
	\min_{x \in [a, b]} f'(x) < \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a} < \max_{x \in [a, b]} f'(x).
	$$
- **Usefulness**: This allows you to bound the function’s growth rate and compare it to its derivative’s values, useful in rate-of-change problems.

### 9\. Behavior at Infinity

- **Description**: If $f'(x)$  is strictly increasing and positive, $f(x)$  will increase without bound as $x \to \infty$  . The specific behavior depends on $f'$  , but growth is guaranteed.
- **Usefulness**: This is relevant for understanding the function’s long-term trends, such as in asymptotic analysis or modeling applications.

### 10\. Comparison with Linear Functions

- **Description**: Between known points like $\frac{1}{2}$  and $1$  , $f(x)$  can be compared to the line $y = x$  . Since it’s strictly convex and matches $y = x$  at the endpoints, it dips below in between.
- **Usefulness**: This comparison aids in visualizing the function or solving equations where $f(x)$  intersects linear functions.

These properties provide a robust toolkit for addressing questions involving such a function. They can be used to analyze its shape, estimate its values or integrals, compare it to other functions, or solve optimization and inequality problems effectively. https://grok.com/chat/69c60ac2-6ab4-4368-83b6-734edb7c9d6e
