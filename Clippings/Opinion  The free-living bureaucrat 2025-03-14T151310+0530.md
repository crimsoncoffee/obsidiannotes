If they’d been asked to write an autopsy of their marriage, Walter and Amanda Smith might have agreed that the cause of death was their lack of understanding of the institution. By the summer of 2021, they were like two people who had formed their own country before agreeing on the rules of citizenship. Walter was drinking too much and going through the motions; Amanda felt trapped and separated from the identity she’d been handed as a child. “I was raised to be a ray of sunshine inside,” she liked to say. “I’m supposed to be the joy of the room.” To which one day Walter blurted out, “You are not a ray of sunshine. You’re a black cloud.” Since they’d collided 10 years earlier in a Texarkana roadside bar — Amanda was the waitress who didn’t mind that Walter had already had too much to drink — they’d never spent a night apart. Both were easy on the eye and quirky and impulsive and extraordinarily willful. Both were also unhappy. Walter had ballooned to 250 pounds and was going through two six-packs of Budweiser a night. Amanda had decided that marrying Walter Smith after knowing him for only five months was the biggest mistake of her life — which was saying something.

### Who is government?

#### Seven writers go in search of the essential public servant

Conversations around the 2024 election were driven by a handful of names. Trump. Harris. Biden. Vance. Walz. But [who really is our government](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/interactive/2025/who-is-government/)? What is it made of? And what is at stake when politicians say they want to expand or dismantle it? To find out, we set seven stellar writers loose on the federal bureaucracy. Their only brief was to go where they wanted, talk with whomever they wanted, and return with a story from deep within the vast, complex system Americans pay for, rebel against, rely upon, dismiss and celebrate. Here are their discoveries.

Still, at first glance, they appeared to have built a life together. They’d bought a place with land around it outside of De Queen, Arkansas. Walter had taken a good, if all-consuming, job fixing anything that broke inside a massive coal-fired power plant an hour’s drive away. At one stretch he worked 12-hour shifts for 93 straight days. They’d accumulated a vast number of animals: chickens, goats, rabbits and cats, along with a surprising number of dogs. “I pick up dogs off the side of the road,” explained Amanda. Inside of six years, Amanda had given birth to three children and was pregnant with a fourth. Walter insisted on naming their first, a boy. Hunter, he’d called him, after one of his favorite writers, Hunter S. Thompson. By cobbling together names from Amanda’s side of the family, he’d named their second child, too, a daughter: Alaina. After that, Amanda seized back the naming rights and, for reasons Walter has never learned, called their third child Henry. The fourth time around, Amanda was racked with indecision. “Infant Smith,” read the baby boy’s birth certificate for the first three months after his birth. “I thought, she’s going to come up with some wild shit,” said Walter. “And one day she says it: Johnathan. And I’m like, you got to be shitting me. It took you three months to call him John Smith?”

## About the author

Michael Lewis is the author, most recently, of “Going Infinite: The Rise and Fall of a New Tycoon.” His other works include “Moneyball,” “The Big Short” and “The Fifth Risk,” which focuses on the functioning of the federal government.

At a glance, they were a union, but by the summer of 2021, they were engaged in something closer to civil war. “I’m doing all the things I’m supposed to do,” said Walter. “But I wasn’t willing to do the shit that made her happy. I was doing the shit that would shut her up. I would do everything I could to keep her off my ass so she would feel guilty to ask me to quit drinking.” For example, he knew that Amanda wanted to rely less on processed foods and more on what they grew themselves. The soil on their farm was poor — just gravel and red clay that required a pickax to dent. And so before Amanda could think to ask him, Walter hauled in endless sacks of enriched soil and erected four massive garden beds.

'WHO IS GOVERNMENT?' by Michael Lewis, forthcoming March 18, 2025.

As he worked, Alaina, then 5 years old, came out to watch and play. She loved hanging around her father. Making mud pies was her favorite hobby. Walter thought nothing of it until he looked up and saw Alaina enveloped in a dust cloud. “Hey, baby, get out from downwind of that,” he said. For a moment, he worried about the effect on her lungs of the dust. But then Alaina moved, and Walter returned to the job of making his wife unhappy.

And so their small nation was divided when its first external threat presented itself. The moment from Sept. 10, 2021, is still vivid in Amanda’s mind. “Hunter runs in and says, ‘Mom, when I’m talking to Alaina, she’s not talking back to me.’” Their 5-year-old was easily their most verbal child. She’d just started kindergarten but was reading and speaking with the fluency of a third-grader. Amanda found her alone, seated. “Eyes open. Staring and not seeing anything. The lights are on but nobody’s home.” Amanda rubbed Alaina’s arms and spoke to her and tried to bring her back from what seemed to be a seizure until finally Alaina came around.

She took her daughter to the emergency room in Texarkana the next day. “The doctor says some kids have seizures and they never have another seizure.” Amanda didn’t like that explanation, but she just assumed the doctor knew what he was talking about. When Alaina suffered a second seizure a few days later, the doctor referred them to a specialist in Plano, Texas. The Plano doctor called for an EEG, and a nurse attached some discs with wires to Alaina’s head, leading to a new diagnosis: epilepsy. “He was the kind of nerdy guy I’d want running the show,” said Amanda, “and he said we just needed to get her on the right drugs.” Walter was less sure: Neither he nor Amanda had epilepsy in their family. Walter felt the doctor should have ordered an MRI — and became more convinced of it after Alaina ingested her epilepsy medicine. “She started screaming that her head hurt and she wanted to die,” recalled Walter. To make it happen faster, she banged her head against the wall and slapped herself. “The only thing the medicine did was change her personality,” said Amanda. “She said she didn’t know why she had to hurt herself, but she had to hurt herself.”

The places Amanda Smith visited to treat her daughter.

That fall, Alaina became less and less herself. She saw polka dots, and the floor often appeared to her to slant downward, like a playground slide. Right away, she had trouble in school. She’d always loved her teachers and was in return beloved. Now she complained of searing headaches, and the teachers accused her of inventing her illness. She went from being far ahead of her class to far behind. Her favorite teacher — a woman Alaina worshiped — turned on her and, after a garbled assignment, gave her an F.

Finally, on Dec. 7, they returned to the Plano doctor — this time with Walter in the role of patient advocate. “You need to tell your husband to calm down,” the doctor said, then followed with a phrase that stuck in both their heads: “I am 98 percent sure that we just need to find her the right medicine.” He finally caved to Walter’s insistence, however, and ordered an MRI. Upon seeing the result, the doctor was clearly shaken. “I was wrong,” he said over the phone. “You need to get her to the Dallas children’s hospital right away.” It tells you something about both Walter and Amanda Smith that, rather than turn on their doctor, they respected his ability to admit his mistake.

The MRI had revealed a mass in Alaina’s brain three centimeters wide. Walter and Amanda met with a surgeon at Children’s Medical Center Dallas who, a week later, at terrifying risk to Alaina, removed the mass from her brain. “It doesn’t feel like a tumor,” the doctor said after the surgery. “It’s not like anything I’ve ever seen.” And it indeed was not a tumor, which struck everyone in the moment as miraculously good news. It was some kind of infection — though no one in Dallas could say for sure which kind. So they shipped it off to Atlanta to be evaluated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

For the next week, Walter and Amanda remained with Alaina in the hospital. No news was good news, and Alaina, by some miracle, seemed not only undamaged by brain surgery but nearly back to her old self. Then, as they packed up to return home for Christmas, several doctors appeared outside her door and beckoned the parents. “They just pointed at the word on their phone and said, ‘This is what she’s got,’” recalled Walter. “They couldn’t even pronounce it. They just said, ‘It’s not good. Don’t even google it.’”

Walter and Amanda took in the word: “Balamuthia.” They’d grown used to being treated, as Walter put it, “as just hicks from the country.” Amanda thought it was more the indifference of a system overwhelmed by demands. “We’re just ants on the anthill,” she said. For the most part they didn’t protest, or expect special treatment, or do anything but allow the doctors to think whatever they thought of them. Their first instinct was to respect their doctors, but they were coming to doubt their infallibility. They googled “Balamuthia” and learned that it was an amoeba that on very rare occasions entered the human brain and consumed it, possibly through the ingestion or inhalation of soil or compost. Walter immediately thought of the raised beds and the swirl of dust.

Even at that point there was still hope in the air — the possibility that the surgery might have completely removed the brain-eating amoebas. That sentiment was tested by yet another MRI, after which a nurse pulled Walter and Amanda into a room. Waiting for them were doctors in white coats. Six doctors sat on one side of the table. Walter and Amanda sat on the other. Someone had arranged for each parent to have a box of tissues — Walter instantly noticed this detail. The doctors showed them the second MRI. “It looked like a bomb had gone off in the back of her head,” said Walter. They listened to the doctors explain what they themselves obviously had only just learned about Balamuthia. How fewer than 200 cases had been reported worldwide and that it had killed 95 percent of the people it had infected. How there was still no known effective treatment for it, just a cocktail of drugs whose only certain effect was to sicken the patient. “They told us again not to look it up,” said Walter, “’cause they’d looked it up. And they’re like, ‘Holy shit, this kid is going to die.’”

The doctors then asked them to sign some forms that would enable them to study Alaina in various ways. They suggested sending an end-of-life expert to her hospital room, but neither Walter nor Amanda were ready for that. Walter was overcome by the feeling that they were going to beat the odds, that through some act of sheer will he’d keep his child alive. But after the meeting, Amanda looked at him and said, “When we get done with this, I’m done with you. I want a divorce.”

Soon after that, the Make-A-Wish people let Alaina know she could make a wish. “I’d like to get something nice for all the little kids in the hospital,” she said. Not long after, she turned to her father and asked, “Am I going to die?”

“Sweetheart,” said Walter, “if you keep a good heart, I promise you’re gonna live.”

Like the other federal bureaucrats I’ve written about, [Heather Stone](https://aaadv.org/bio-pages/heather-stone/?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template), and her function, were buried under six layers on an agency organization chart. The agency in her case was the Food and Drug Administration, and her function was to help doctors find new treatments for rare, deadly diseases. Like these other subjects, she was shocked to be discovered and explained nervously that she was unable to speak with me without the permission of the agency’s communications team. As always, that team felt uneasy about me communicating anything about this faceless government employee. Please submit the list of questions you intend to ask. Perhaps you’d prefer to speak instead with her politically appointed boss who would make for a far more important story? Any journalist who turns up inside the federal bureaucracy asking simple, if open-ended, questions — who is this person, what is she doing, and why is she doing it? — becomes an object of suspicion, which is maybe why you read so few case studies about them. As it turned out, Heather Stone really wanted to answer my questions. It just took a few months for her to shed the layers on the org chart designed to keep her from doing it.

She’d grown up in a down-and-out region of rural Maryland that felt a lot more like nearby West Virginia than it did Bethesda. Her mother, Judy Stone, worked as an infectious-disease doctor — and the variety of diseases that emerged from the hollows of the Appalachian Mountains was astonishing. “We’d get stopped all the time,” said Heather. “Like when we’d go to the grocery store. They’d say to her, ‘You saved my mother’s life.’” Judy worked impossible hours and tried to make up for it by involving her daughter in her work. She’d bring Heather on hospital rounds and would often leave her behind in a room to cheer up a patient. When she returned from a long work trip to Peru, she handed Heather the notebook she kept of the exotic diseases she’d observed and the way the doctors there had treated them. She let her peruse the enormous binders that she kept for FDA-approved clinical drug trials. These, Heather could see, had special importance for her mom. “She always thought that the way she would have lasting impact was to develop new treatments.” By middle school, Heather had learned everything from the incredible transmissibility of [Q fever](https://www.cdc.gov/q-fever/about/index.html?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template) (you could catch it just by driving past a farm with the window down) to how to treat an iguana bite. She also knew what she wanted to be when she grew up. “When I grew up, I wanted to be my mom.”

By high school, Heather was finding ways to work for her mother. She talked her mother into taking her for a three-week trip to Dharamshala, India, for example, where they worked together in an AIDS clinic. And she roped her mom into turning her school projects into semiprofessional events. The summer before her senior year, Heather noticed that members of her high school marching band, who practiced on a dusty field, were contracting respiratory illnesses at a shockingly high rate. Together, she and her mom made a study of it. They attached culture plates to the uniforms of Heather’s fellow band members and collected samples — in which they found all kinds of bacteria but no obvious pathogen. “Does Marching Band Make You Sick?” nevertheless made it to the finals of the 2006 Young Epidemiology Scholars competition in Washington (and got written about in [The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/2006/04/26/marching-band-and-other-hazards-of-high-school/f0a67ab5-bd1e-4ff0-b7c8-17a965d95c32/?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template)).

There were many paths open to Heather Stone. She was an excellent all-around student. She was stunningly pretty — she came in third at regionals and progressed to the finals of the Miss Maryland Teen USA pageant. She was blessed with a three-octave range that landed her the lead in all the school musicals and the role of lead singer in a local rock band. And she had a natural charm about her. (“She could sell dead cats to the board of health,” as her mother put it.) None of her extracurriculars tempted her off the path she’d chosen for herself: to cure rare infectious diseases. But it was as if disease had sensed what she was up to and set out to stop her.

At the age of 7 she contracted strep throat. That was normal enough until it was followed by [PANDAS syndrome](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/23553-pandas-syndrome?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template) — an autoimmune disorder that occurs in roughly one in 100,000 cases of strep. Heather, who had nothing obviously wrong with her, began to walk only on certain tiles on the floor and to measure her dental floss exactly before she used it: severe obsessive-compulsive disorder was one of PANDAS’s symptoms. “I went from being bubbly and happy-go-lucky to quite the opposite,” she said. “People didn’t understand why I was acting crazy, and I didn’t understand why I was acting crazy and couldn’t stop.”

She was born to be a doctor, but life kept turning her into a patient. In time, her OCD dwindled, but other treats followed. Intense stomach pain, for example, which through middle school she was told was all in her head — until a doctor at Johns Hopkins Hospital discovered inside her a bacteria, Helicobacter, more normally found in stressed-out middle-aged men, and known for causing stomach ulcers. Right through high school and well into college, she suffered a mysterious chronic pain — eventually diagnosed as [fibromyalgia](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/fibromyalgia?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template#:~:text=Fibromyalgia%20is%20a%20condition%20that,may%20last%20all%20day%20long.). Cause unknown, and no easy treatment. The pain rendered her incapable of holding her mellophone and forced her to quit marching band.

Time and again her immune system let her down in the most shocking ways. As a sophomore at Smith College, she caught what she thought was a simple cold. She recovered to discover her vocal range reduced from three octaves to a single octave, and then her singing career was over, too. “I’ve learned to tell my doctors to skip the horses and think zebras,” she said, “and to assume that whatever it is, it won’t be minor. I’m perpetually terrified I’m going to catch something again.” She learned, also, that she probably couldn’t physically handle medical school.

And yet — after all of this — she remained determined to play some kind of role in the search for cures for infectious diseases. After Smith, she’d gone to graduate school at the University of Maryland, where she studied epidemiology. Searching for a job in global public health, she landed one only vaguely related to the field: a fellowship inside the part of the FDA that evaluates medical devices. She liked the people but hated the work. “I kept trying to find a rare-infectious-disease angle to it,” she said.

One day, while on the FDA’s campus in Silver Spring, she slipped away from her desk to attend a talk about the search for new cures given by a guy from the [Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation](https://www.gatesfoundation.org/?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template). She lined up at the microphone in the aisle with a question in mind: What are you doing about the problem of drug discovery for rare disease, which the market has no interest in solving? An older man preceded her at the microphone. “What are you doing about the problem of drug discovery for rare disease?” he asked. Hey, that’s my question! she thought. Afterward, she introduced herself to the older man. His name was [Leonard Sacks](https://aaadv.org/bio-pages/leonard-sacks/?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template), and he was an infectious-disease doctor from South Africa. Before coming to the FDA, Sacks had spent years treating drug-resistant tuberculosis. He’d developed a special interest in the paucity of treatments for so many rare infectious diseases. And he had an idea: create some mechanism so that doctors who treated rare diseases could report their cases. All over the world, tens of thousands of times a year, some doctor was trying to improve on some unsatisfying treatment for some deadly affliction. And no one was recording what had worked and what had not.

Until that moment, it was only an idea. Heather offered to quit her current job and make it a reality. It might not be true that everyone in government who does anything especially useful starts out with a problem they want to solve, but it certainly helps. And Heather had a problem she wanted to solve: the difficulty of finding new treatments for rare disease. It didn’t much matter where she did it. The CDC might have been a more natural host for their project than the FDA, but Sacks didn’t work for the CDC. Neither did Heather, who was soon hired by Sacks and moved from one faceless red-brick FDA building to another.

If you pull up the org chart for the FDA, you’ll find a rectangular box marked “commissioner” above a row of eight smaller boxes. Their logic is not obvious — a couple sound like bureaucracy without obvious function (Office of External Affairs), and a couple seem satisfyingly specific (Center for Tobacco Products), but the names of the others are so general that they might do anything (Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research). One way to think of the entire FDA is as the Department of Ingestion. It sets the rules for just about every food, liquid, drug, vaccine or medical device people might voluntarily put inside themselves or their animals. And while it isn’t easy to imagine what the people inside the boxes do, it’s not hard to divine their relative status. For that, all you need to know is the size of their budgets. The little box called [Center for Drug Evaluation and Research](https://www.fda.gov/about-fda/fda-organization/center-drug-evaluation-and-research-cder?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template), to which Heather now moved, had more money than the Center for Devices and Radiological Health, which she was leaving behind. It was not just a step up in boxes but a better place to pursue her obsessive interest. Her title was science policy analyst, but as she explained, “That’s just what they call you when they don’t know what else to call you.”

The website and the app took several years to design and test. She had to figure out how to keep the forms brief, so that doctors would fill them out. She had to make sure they worked all over the world, and she traveled to foreign countries to test them. There were countries, such as China, where it was illegal to use drugs for anything other than their explicit purpose, so any doctor in China who cured a patient with a repurposed drug would want to remain anonymous. And there was just the sheer range of possible information and misinformation.

There exist something like [10,000 known rare diseases](https://ncats.nih.gov/research/our-impact/our-impact-rare-diseases?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template), and more than 2,000 drugs approved for use in Europe and the United States. The FDA couldn’t allow just anyone to post anything. [CURE ID](https://cure.ncats.io/home?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template) — as the site and app became known — needed to be at least lightly refereed to keep the kooky stuff out. The point was to collect the stories that weren’t collected in medicine because they were stories, not science. Case studies, not randomized controlled trials. “Most journals won’t publish case reports because they don’t think they are valuable because they are merely anecdotes,” said Heather. For rare diseases, these anecdotes were all you had to go on, and some of them certainly had value — even if they told you about some treatment that had failed. You didn’t want people saying you could cure covid by drinking bleach. But short of that, what doctors had done with patients dying from rare disease, and how those patients responded, had obvious value.

Almost as soon as Heather started in her new job, in 2013, she began to sense problems. The criticism was mostly internal. The most common was that the website and app she created would be publicizing something other than evidence-based medicine: The FDA, of all places, shouldn’t be putting its name on anything that wasn’t scientifically respectable. “Even my mom, when I first told her about it, said, ‘I don’t know about that.’” To which Heather argued that there was never going to be conventional, evidence-based medicine for rare, deadly diseases and that “some data is better than no data.” That silenced some of the internal critics. But they had another objection: The vast majority of these rare diseases were tropical and never occurred inside the United States. Why should the U.S. government do anything to help to cure them? “There’s a reason the United States Army has invested so heavily in tropical disease research,” Heather would say. But it wasn’t just that we might one day need to cure our soldiers in some foreign jungle. There was goodwill to be won abroad, at little expense, by providing the service. She thought of CURE ID as a form of soft power.

Both the CURE ID website and the app were finally released in 2019. For a stretch, no one was interested in anything but covid, but that didn’t explain the state of affairs two years later or, for that matter, today. She’d underestimated the effects of, among other things, the current mistrust of the government, and what amounted to government’s mistrust of itself. The FDA gave her no budget to market it — she hadn’t expected one. The institution viscerally feared public attention: How could she tell a story that would attract other people’s stories if she wasn’t allowed to speak?

She dismissed a third criticism she’d heard while building the new tool: You’ll never get doctors to use it. They’re too busy to submit their cases. “I’d go to rare-infectious-disease conferences and doctors would tell me, ‘That’s a fantastic idea,’ and then fail to submit their own cases.” She knew there were thousands of relevant case studies of rare disease each year in which some doctor repurposed some drug with effects that would interest other doctors. Within the first five years of its launch, CURE ID received from doctors a grand total of 200 case reports on rare infectious diseases. It was as if everyone else looked around and saw that no one else was telling their stories, so they kept mum, too. And the FDA exerted no pressure, or provided no incentive, for them to come forward.

Heather had only been able to hire a couple of people to help her. Her small team set out to do the work they had imagined a million doctors would do: find cases and report them. They scoured the literature, but academic journals tended to view case studies as mere stories unworthy of publication. Which, of course, was why CURE ID needed to exist in the first place: to surface the stories. In the early days, she grew desperate enough that she called her mother and asked her to report her old cases. Her mother went back into the journal she kept from that research trip to Peru, where she had seen local doctors treat exotic diseases in new ways. With her mother’s help, Heather entered CURE ID’s very first clinical case: Balamuthia.

An amoeba that on very rare occasions enters and eats the human brain isn’t a problem the free market is likely to solve. There are never enough people dying of Balamuthia and willing to pay for a cure for a big pharmaceutical company to spend the money to find one. Even if the pharmaceutical industry sought a cure, it would find it impossible to proceed in the usual way. You can’t study the effects of some drug on Balamuthia the way you might with, say, covid. You can’t gather up some large number of Balamuthia patients, divide them into two groups and treat half of them with some experimental drug and the other half with a placebo. For a start, there aren’t enough people at any one time with Balamuthia in their brains, and those who have it usually don’t survive long enough for a trial. But even if there were somehow a Balamuthia epidemic, it would be impossible to deny half the victims any experimental treatment that offered even the faintest hope of survival. Diseases that are at once extremely rare and extremely deadly are perfectly designed to elude conventional drug discovery.

Enter [Joe DeRisi](https://profiles.ucsf.edu/joe.derisi?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template). A biochemist at the University of California at San Francisco (and a character in a book I wrote about the coronavirus pandemic, “[The Premonition](https://www.amazon.com/Premonition-Pandemic-Story-Michael-Lewis/dp/0393881555?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template)”), DeRisi likes to push back against conventions. He’s a scientist who finds the usual panzer-division-like march to knowledge tedious. He spends less time generating hypotheses and testing them than finding new tools to wander around inside the invisible world, just to see what he might find.

Case in point: In August 2015, a 74-year-old Chinese woman turned up in the emergency room of the UCSF-affiliated Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital and Trauma Center. She had a cough and a loss of vision in her left eye. After inspecting an MRI of her brain, the doctors guessed that she’d suffered a series of tiny strokes. They watched her closely for three uneventful days before releasing her. Two days later, her family wheeled her back to the hospital, unconscious. The doctors took more pictures of her brain. “It looked like a grenade had gone off in her skull,” recalled DeRisi. “It wasn’t like, ‘Oh, now we get what it is.’ It was more like, ‘What the f--- just happened?’” The doctors then pumped her with every drug they could think of; her hospital bill would exceed $1 million. She failed to respond to any of the treatments and died 16 days after she’d been admitted.

Two weeks after the Chinese woman’s death, DeRisi had a call from one of the doctors who still couldn’t figure out what had killed his patient. All anyone knew was that the woman’s brain no longer resembled a normal brain: Its cells appeared to have expanded, crazily. “They biopsied her brain and sent it to all the things you could send it to, but no one could figure it out,” said DeRisi.

This happened surprisingly often. “Unidentified encephalitis” was the official cause of death of 20,000 Americans a year. But by then DeRisi was already a little bit famous for solving this sort of medical mystery. He’d helped to develop the first machines that could take a DNA sample from inside a human being and sift it for anything that wasn’t human, and then further determine what exactly it was inside a person that wasn’t meant to be. “You really shouldn’t see anything that isn’t human,” said DeRisi. But the real beauty of the new technology was that it didn’t require you to know what you were looking for: The scientist didn’t need a hypothesis. “You aren’t bound by what you’ve seen before,” said DeRisi. “The sequencing doesn’t care what you’ve seen before.”

The UCSF doctors sent DeRisi brain tissue and spinal fluid, and DeRisi, together with his colleague Michael Wilson, ran them through his machines. It took days to prepare the samples but just minutes for the computer to spit out a list of matches with any known nonhuman genetic material. “Michael and I both look at the list and say, ‘What the hell is Balamuthia? It was just an alien word.” They googled around and found pictures of giant cells identical to the ones in the woman’s brain. “It was the holy shit moment. These moments in medicine are rare. Normally it’s murky and uncertain. This is like it all instantly snaps into perfect focus.”

The pathogen they’d discovered was formally known as [Balamuthia mandrillaris](https://www.cdc.gov/balamuthia/about/index.html?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template) — so dubbed in 1986 after a disciple of the parasitologist William Balamuth found it inside the brain of a dead mandrill in the San Diego Zoo. Balamuthia — as DeRisi now learned — was one of three kinds of single-celled organisms classified as “free-living amoebas,” which of course raises questions not only about their lifestyles but those of other species of amoebas. “Free-living,” it turns out, means only that the amoeba is neither purely parasitic nor purely not, but is able to move fluidly between the two states. A nonbinary amoeba. Able to survive without a host, it occasionally, for reasons unknown even to itself, devours its host. Why or how often it does this is unclear — and DeRisi would soon have reason to assume that the half-dozen or so cases a year reported in the United States omitted many deaths in which the amoeba was never identified. Before the invention of the genomic sequencing machines, Balamuthia could be spotted only by the rare microbiologist who knew what it looked like and went looking for it.

At any rate, the Chinese woman’s shocking death led DeRisi to wonder: What if they’d diagnosed her while she was still alive? Searching further, he discovered that the treatment for Balamuthia suggested by the CDC was a regimen of five drugs. “It was a cocktail of crap,” said DeRisi. “The drugs had really nasty side effects, and very little proven efficacy.” It was just the stuff that had been pumped into a few people who happened to have survived. The same drugs had been pumped into even more who died. If the doctors had diagnosed the woman while she was still alive, there was little they could have done.

And there was zero chance that some pharmaceutical company was going to ride to the rescue with some new cure. “The only hope,” said DeRisi, “is drugs that have already been in people. And okay, if that’s true, let’s try every drug ever approved in Europe or by the FDA.” He set his graduate students loose on the problem. They grew Balamuthia in the lab and bombarded it with the 2,177 drugs approved in either the United States or Europe. All but one were ineffective. And the one, very oddly, stopped Balamuthia in its tracks. It was called [nitroxoline](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Nitroxoline?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template). An antibiotic long used for urinary tract infections outside the United States, it was neither used nor approved for use in the United States. Its ability to kill Balamuthia inside a lab was no guarantee that it would do the same inside a human. But for the first time in the brief recorded history of this free-living amoeba, there was hope.

DeRisi and his students wrote up their findings in an [academic paper published in 2018](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6212833/?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template). And that, they assumed, was that. DeRisi wasn’t a medical doctor; he could only hope that any doctor who figured out that their patient was dying of Balamuthia would find his paper. “That’s where the story might have ended,” said DeRisi.

It’s not the end of the story. There is no story that Joe DeRisi’s work on Balamuthia feels like the end of. There are just some questions. For example: If Joe DeRisi discovered a possible treatment for Balamuthia in 2018 and wrote it up in a peer-reviewed paper, how was it possible, more than three years later, that the doctors in a children’s hospital ranked No. 16 in the country by U.S. News and World Report didn’t know about it?

I asked DeRisi a version of this question soon after he’d written that paper: “Now that you’ve discovered this new treatment, everyone will know about it and I no longer need to worry about Balamuthia, right?” He sort of laughed at the absurdity of the question and said, “Nope!” I pressed him a bit. “Isn’t there someplace that gathers this sort of knowledge and makes sure doctors have it at their fingertips?” He just laughed again and said, “You’d think so, but there isn’t. It doesn’t really pay anyone to do it.” Then he added, “Actually, there is this one woman who is trying to do this. She’s at the FDA. But she’s fighting a solo battle. I’m not sure anyone there even knows what she’s doing, and so I don’t know how that’s going to work out.”

On the lookout for useful material, Heather Stone wound up attending one of Joe DeRisi’s presentations, on the effects of nitroxoline on the free-living amoeba. It was on Zoom, and Heather started punching buttons. “I was trying to get him to see me in the chatroom. We need to talk!” They indeed did talk, after the presentation, and then again, nine months later, when DeRisi called her out of the blue on a holiday weekend to ask how he might get FDA approval to use nitroxoline in a patient infected by Balamuthia. It emerged that it wasn’t a UCSF patient; some doctor elsewhere in the United States had seen DeRisi’s findings about nitroxoline and called up UCSF. DeRisi had called the one person inside the FDA he knew, Heather Stone, and asked if she could help him obtain emergency approval to use the drug. Heather not only helped but taught him how to work the system in case he needed ever to do it again: DeRisi was taken aback by how easy she’d made it. “I think of the FDA as this faceless, placeless bureaucratic machine, and it would be worse than getting your driver’s license renewed,” he said.

In that case, what slowed down the treatment was not government bureaucracy but the private companies that manufactured the drug. Most saw no upside in treating Balamuthia. By the time DeRisi found a Chinese supplier of nitroxoline, the patient had died. Whoever the doctor was didn’t bother to write the case up on CURE ID. “Nobody knows about it,” said Heather. “If nobody knows about it and nobody uses it — I don’t want to say I failed, but if we can’t demonstrate success it’s not going to exist at all.”

Such was the state of affairs in early September 2022 when Heather arrived in her office and listened to her voicemail. Her voicemail was mainly junk mail — no one she wanted to talk to just called her on her office phone — and so she didn’t normally check it, but for some reason that morning she did. “Good morning, Miss Stone, my name is Amanda Smith,” said a woman’s voice before, with a willed calm, the speaker explained that her child had Balamuthia and that she had just read about this new drug called nitroxoline. “Our hospital can’t get nitroxoline, and I was wondering if you can help,” she said. That’s when the young woman’s voice hit a snag and she began to sob. Unable to calm herself, she apologized for crying and said, “If you could give me a call back, I sure would appreciate it.”

“Our hospital can’t get nitroxoline, and I was wondering if you can help.”

Soon after her diagnosis, Alaina Smith was put on the cocktail of five drugs recommended by the CDC. She couldn’t keep them down. For three weeks she tried to take them orally. “Every time they’d give them to her she’d sit up like \[in\] ‘The Exorcist’ and vomit across the room,” said Walter. “She’d throw it all up and they didn’t want to give us anymore.” The doctors created a button in her side that enabled them to pump the drugs directly into her stomach — and then it seemed to her parents a question of what might kill her first: the drugs or the free-living amoeba.

On at least one of the drugs — pentamidine — she survived longer than any known patient. “You could see the color of her skin change when we put it in her,” said Walter. Four months into her treatment, the doctors sent her home, where Walter and Amanda continued to give her the drugs. “She was dying right in front of us,” said Walter. “She was gray. Her kidneys were failing. They said she might need a bone-marrow transplant.” Home, like the hospital room, was a pressure cooker. It flipped a switch inside Walter, and maybe in Amanda, too. “I was meandering through life and causing havoc in everyone else’s heart,” he said. “I decided to stop.” He stopped drinking, too. He started asking himself what he needed to do to be a better man. He’d been an atheist his entire life, but now he offered God a deal: If you let her live, I will never again do anything that I’m not supposed to do. And for a moment, God appeared to accept it.

But then, in late July 2022, they returned for yet another MRI. The picture revealed a new mass nearly two centimeters wide in her frontal lobe, which the surgeon promptly removed. Both parents were now frantic: The drugs seemed to be killing brain tissue but leaving the amoeba to roam. “I said, ‘What are we doing here,’” said Amanda, “‘just scooping out parts of her brain until there is nothing left to scoop out?’”

What happened next is — well, no one thought it’s what should have happened, but everyone later agreed it was a sign of hidden forces beyond human control. Late one night that August, Amanda’s mother, Kathryn Keithley, just started googling “Balamuthia.” Amanda thought Walter had googled the story of each and every one of the small handful of Balamuthia survivors, but apparently not. For her mother now discovered the preprint of a new paper co-authored by, among other people, Joe DeRisi. It described a case study of the use of nitroxoline on a middle-aged white man who lived off the grid and had wandered into the University of California at San Francisco six months before Alaina had been diagnosed. The man had survived. Kathryn handed the paper to Amanda. Amanda read it and called their doctor at Children’s Medical Center Dallas, who said, “Where did you find this? Our people haven’t even found this.” But the doctor sounded hesitant, and so Amanda went back to the paper and wondered how she might reach every last person involved with it. LinkedIn, she decided. And so she opened an account, and under “Experience & Education” she simply wrote, “Mother Trying To Save Her Daughter.” “I created it in a state of panic,” she said. “I needed an account to get access to these people.”

Then she noticed that the authors had thanked someone named Heather Stone at the FDA for getting them the emergency authorization to use the untested drug.

Heather Stone listened to the voicemail and quickly pieced together what had happened. Nine months earlier, a UCSF doctor named Natasha Spottiswoode — who happened to know Joe DeRisi — had used nitroxoline to treat a middle-aged man with Balamuthia. The man survived, and the drug had little or no side effects. No one bothered to tell Heather — or to write it up on CURE ID — but they thanked her in a paper that they had just written about it.

Heather knew that with Balamuthia, days might matter, and that it could take weeks for the pills to arrive from the Chinese company that had so graciously supplied the drug to the California doctors. She also knew that the only nitroxoline in the country would be whatever pills were left over from the recently saved California man. She called Joe DeRisi and Natasha Spottiswoode and arranged for them to ship their supply to Children’s Medical Center Dallas. She then obtained a letter for Children’s Medical Center Dallas from the FDA’s review division “saying it was okay to use it and we wouldn’t sue them.” The Smiths had the nitroxoline within 24 hours.

Walter and Amanda made the decision to take Alaina off the old drugs all by themselves, and so they sort of ran their own controlled experiment. When the nitroxoline arrived on Sept. 11, 2022, they gave it to Alaina ground up in orange juice. She kept it down. Within days, her color returned. Her nausea subsided. Her energy returned. Then her anger vanished. Two months later, she was free of symptoms, and an MRI showed her lesions shrinking. Two years later her brain appeared to have rid itself entirely of any free-living amoebas. “She became herself again,” said Amanda.

To all involved, it felt like a miracle. To the Smiths, it wasn’t just that their child had been saved: The presence of a common, deadly enemy had changed their marriage, in much the same way it would change an entire society. Amanda no longer wanted a divorce; Walter no longer secretly wanted her to want one. He wanted only to be the sort of man who could make her happy. One afternoon, during a break at work, he and his colleagues struck up an odd conversation. Someone else started it by asking, “What do you think our wives actually think of us?” And Walter thought: I don’t fully know the answer to that question. On the spot, he called up Amanda.

“Am I a good man?” asked Walter.

“Baby, it’s odd that you asked me that,” said Amanda, “because I was just thinking about that. And I think you’re the greatest man I ever met.”

Walter hid the tears in his eyes from the other guys.

To both Walter and Amanda Smith, that felt like the end of the story. “Somehow the whole experience ended up being the best thing that could happen to our family,” said Walter. He and Amanda were mainly just filled with gratitude — for each other, for the doctors who tried so hard, for Walter’s colleagues who took up collections and put in something like 400 hours of overtime so he could be in the hospital room with his child. They were grateful to the Chinese company, [Asieris Pharmaceuticals](https://asieris.com/?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template), that eventually topped up their nitroxoline supply free of charge. “They wouldn’t even let us pay them — not even for shipping,” said Walter. They were grateful to a guy named Chester Barber who runs the De Queen Health and Wellness Pharmacy and who got them the drugs they thought they needed. Their medical bills for the treatment before the cure came to $4 million, but that was largely covered by Walter’s employer’s insurance, so they were grateful even for that. “Here’s the only thing I feel bad about,” said Amanda. “All those kids whose parents weren’t there.”

But that really isn’t the end of the story. The healing of Alaina Smith is just a single unfinished case study, and there’s no telling how it will end. The whole thing feels like a miracle, but if all our systems had worked the way they should work, there’d have been no need for miracles. In San Francisco, a researcher at one of the leading medical research centers in the world finds a new and promising treatment for a rare and deadly disease. Three years later, in Dallas, a little girl with the disease walks into one of the leading hospitals in the country. Between those two events, a woman inside the federal government who was as good as born for the job creates a tool to let doctors anywhere in the world know what others anywhere else in the world have discovered. And yet the doctors in San Francisco and Dallas, like the doctors most everywhere else, neglected the tool, in part because it doesn’t pay but in part because it was created by the federal government. It’s as if a society had been handed a mechanism for saving itself but had a built-in rule against using the mechanism. Heather Stone helped to save Alaina Smith, but the tool she created played no role at all — which doesn’t sound like a big deal. But then it also failed to play a role in the treatment of a 4-year-old girl in Northern California, an hour’s drive from Joe DeRisi’s lab, who contracted Balamuthia not long after Alaina Smith was saved, and who died because her doctors learned of the possible cure too late.
