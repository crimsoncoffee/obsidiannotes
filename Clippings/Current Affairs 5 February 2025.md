**CRISIL: India’s GDP to** **grow at** **6.5% in FY26; CAD widen to 1.3%**

According to the **CRISIL Ratings Limited** (formerly Credit Rating and Information Services of India Limited) latest report, India’s Gross Domestic Product **(GDP)** is projected to grow by **6.5****%** in the Financial Year 2025-26 **(FY26)****,** marginally higher than the 6.4% growth estimated for current financial year (FY25).

- However, a strong services trade balance, steady remittances, and lower crude oil prices will help in preventing sharp increase in the deficit.
