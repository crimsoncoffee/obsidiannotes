To determine how many games in a chess tournament feature a boy and a girl, we start by carefully analyzing the problem. The tournament involves both boys and girls, with each player playing against every other player exactly once. There are 45 games in total, and 15 of them feature only boys. Our goal is to find the number of games that feature a boy and a girl.

### Step 1: Define the Variables and Total Games

Let’s denote:

- $b$  as the number of boys,
- $g$  as the number of girls,
- $n$  as the total number of players, where $n = b + g$  .

Since each player plays every other player exactly once, the total number of games is the number of ways to choose 2 players out of $n$  , given by the combination formula $C(n, 2) = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}$  . The problem states there are 45 games, so:

$$
\frac{n(n-1)}{2} = 45
$$

Multiply both sides by 2:

$$
n(n-1) = 90
$$

Solve the quadratic equation $n^2 - n - 90 = 0$  using the quadratic formula $n = \frac{-B \pm \sqrt{B^2 - 4AC}}{2A}$  , where $A = 1$  , $B = -1$  , and $C = -90$  :

$$
\text{Discriminant} = (-1)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-90) = 1 + 360 = 361 = 19^2
$$
 
$$
n = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{361}}{2} = \frac{1 \pm 19}{2}
$$
 
$$
n = \frac{1 + 19}{2} = 10 \quad \text{or} \quad n = \frac{1 - 19}{2} = -9
$$

Since $n$  must be positive, $n = 10$  . Thus, there are 10 players, and:

$$
b + g = 10
$$

### Step 2: Categorize the Games

Each game involves two players and can be:

- **Two boys** (only boys),
- **Two girls** (only girls),
- **One boy and one girl** (mixed games).

The total number of games is the sum of these types:

- Number of games with two boys: $C(b, 2) = \frac{b(b-1)}{2}$  ,
- Number of games with two girls: $C(g, 2) = \frac{g(g-1)}{2}$  ,
- Number of mixed games (one boy and one girl): $b \cdot g$  .

So:

$$
C(b, 2) + C(g, 2) + b \cdot g = 45
$$

We’re given that the number of games featuring only boys is 15:

$$
C(b, 2) = \frac{b(b-1)}{2} = 15
$$

Multiply by 2:

$$
b(b-1) = 30
$$
 
$$
b^2 - b - 30 = 0
$$

Discriminant: $1 + 120 = 121 = 11^2$  ,

$$
b = \frac{1 \pm 11}{2}
$$
 
$$
b = \frac{12}{2} = 6 \quad \text{or} \quad b = \frac{-10}{2} = -5
$$

Since $b > 0$  , $b = 6$  . Then:

$$
g = 10 - b = 10 - 6 = 4
$$

So, there are 6 boys and 4 girls.

### Step 3: Calculate the Number of Mixed Games

The number of games featuring a boy and a girl is the number of ways to pair one boy with one girl:

$$
b \cdot g = 6 \cdot 4 = 24
$$

### Step 4: Verify the Solution

Let’s compute all game types to ensure consistency:

- Only boys: $C(6, 2) = \frac{6 \cdot 5}{2} = 15$  , which matches the given 15.
- Only girls: $C(4, 2) = \frac{4 \cdot 3}{2} = 6$  ,
- Mixed: $6 \cdot 4 = 24$  .

Total games:

$$
15 + 6 + 24 = 45
$$

This equals the total number of games, confirming our calculations. Alternatively, total games via $C(10, 2)$  :

$$
C(10, 2) = \frac{10 \cdot 9}{2} = 45
$$

This also matches, and the breakdown is consistent.

### Step 5: Interpret the Question

The phrase “feature a boy and a girl” means games with exactly one boy and one girl, as “only boys” covers two boys, and by symmetry, two girls are separate. Thus, $b \cdot g = 24$  is the number of such games.

### Final Answer

The number of games that feature a boy and a girl is 24. Checking the options (A) 6, (B) 15, (C) 20, (D) 24, the answer is (D) 24.

**Answer: 24**

How could I have known to not miss the detail that the 45 was the clue along with each player playing with other once. Because when I was solving it I completely missed and I was running in circle with the 15 games. What is the method to not miss such details

To address your query about how to avoid missing critical details like the total number of games being 45 and the fact that each player plays every other player exactly once in the chess tournament problem, let’s walk through a methodical approach. You mentioned getting stuck on the 15 games featuring only boys and running in circles, which suggests that focusing on one detail caused you to lose sight of the bigger picture. Here’s how you can prevent that in the future, followed by a solution to the problem to illustrate the method.

### Method to Avoid Missing Key Details

When solving problems like this, especially in combinatorics or word problems, it’s easy to latch onto one number (like the 15 boy-boy games) and miss others that are equally important (like the total of 45 games). Here’s a step-by-step strategy to ensure you capture and use all the given information effectively:

1. **Read Carefully and List All Given Information**  
	Start by reading the problem slowly and noting every piece of data provided. Write them down as a list so nothing slips through the cracks. For this problem, you’d write:
	- Total number of games: 45
	- Games featuring only boys: 15
	- Each player plays every other player exactly once
	- Need to find: number of games featuring a boy and a girl  
		This list acts as a checklist, ensuring you don’t overlook anything.
2. **Understand the Problem’s Structure**  
	Ask yourself: what kind of problem is this? The phrase “each player plays every other player exactly once” signals a round-robin tournament, where every pair of players forms a game. In combinatorics, the number of ways to choose 2 items (or players) from $n$  is given by the combination formula $C(n, 2) = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}$  . Recognizing this structure ties the total games (45) to the total number of players, which is a critical insight.
3. **Identify Variables and Relationships**  
	Define your variables based on the problem’s context. Here, there are boys and girls, so let:
	- $b$  \= number of boys
	- $g$  \= number of girls
	- $n = b + g$  \= total number of players  
		The games can then be categorized into:
	- Boy-boy games: $C(b, 2) = \frac{b(b-1)}{2}$
	- Girl-girl games: $C(g, 2) = \frac{g(g-1)}{2}$
	- Boy-girl games: $b \cdot g$  (since each boy plays each girl exactly once)  
		The total games are the sum: $C(b, 2) + C(g, 2) + b \cdot g = 45$  .
4. **Set Up Equations Using All Data**  
	Use every piece of information to build equations. From the problem:
	- Total games: $\frac{n(n-1)}{2} = 45$
	- Boy-boy games: $\frac{b(b-1)}{2} = 15$  
		This ensures you’re not just fixating on the 15 but also connecting it to the 45.
5. **Solve Step by Step**  
	Work through the equations systematically, using one piece of data at a time, and check your progress. If you get stuck, revisit your list of given information to see what you haven’t used yet.
6. **Verify Your Solution**  
	After finding an answer, plug it back into the problem to ensure all conditions are met. This catches errors and reinforces the use of all details.

### Applying the Method to Solve the Problem

Let’s solve the problem using this approach to show how it keeps all details in play.

- **Step 1: List the Information**
	- Total games = 45
	- Boy-boy games = 15
	- Each player plays every other player once
	- Find: boy-girl games
- **Step 2: Understand the Structure**  
	Since each player plays every other player once, the total number of games is $C(n, 2) = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}$  , and this equals 45.
- **Step 3: Define Variables**
	- $n$  \= total players
	- $b$  \= number of boys
	- $g$  \= number of girls
	- $n = b + g$  
		Games are:
	- Boy-boy: $\frac{b(b-1)}{2} = 15$
	- Boy-girl: $b \cdot g$  (what we need)
	- Girl-girl: $\frac{g(g-1)}{2}$
	- Total: $\frac{b(b-1)}{2} + \frac{g(g-1)}{2} + b \cdot g = 45$
- **Step 4: Set Up Equations**
	- From total games: $\frac{n(n-1)}{2} = 45$  
		Multiply by 2: $n(n-1) = 90$  
		Solve: $n^2 - n - 90 = 0$  
		Factor: $(n-10)(n+9) = 0$  
		$n = 10$  (since $n$  is positive)  
		So, there are 10 players.
	- From boy-boy games: $\frac{b(b-1)}{2} = 15$  
		Multiply by 2: $b(b-1) = 30$  
		Solve: $b^2 - b - 30 = 0$  
		Factor: $(b-6)(b+5) = 0$  
		$b = 6$  (since $b$  is positive)  
		Then, $g = n - b = 10 - 6 = 4$  .
- **Step 5: Solve for Boy-Girl Games**  
	Number of boy-girl games = $b \cdot g = 6 \cdot 4 = 24$  .
- **Step 6: Verify**
	- Boy-boy games: $\frac{6 \cdot 5}{2} = 15$  (matches)
	- Girl-girl games: $\frac{4 \cdot 3}{2} = 6$
	- Boy-girl games: $6 \cdot 4 = 24$
	- Total: $15 + 6 + 24 = 45$  (matches)  
		Everything checks out.

### Why You Missed the Detail and How to Fix It

You got stuck on the 15 boy-boy games because it’s a concrete number that’s easy to focus on, while the total of 45 and the “each player plays every other” rule felt less immediate. By not connecting the 45 to the total number of players right away, you couldn’t move forward. The method above prevents this by:

- Forcing you to list all data upfront (so 45 isn’t ignored).
- Linking the structure (round-robin) to the total games early, giving you $n = 10$  , which anchors the problem.
- Using each piece of information systematically, so you don’t over-focus on one part (the 15) without relating it to the whole.

### Final Answer

The number of games featuring a boy and a girl is 24. To avoid missing key details like the total of 45 games in the future, always start by listing all given information, understand the problem’s structure, define variables, set up equations, solve step by step, and verify your work. This keeps you from running in circles and ensures every clue is used effectively. https://grok.com/chat/6a6b1b08-cfbf-43b6-bfa4-322fd835b49f
