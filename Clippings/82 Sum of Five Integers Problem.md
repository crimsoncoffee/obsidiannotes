Let’s dive into this intriguing problem involving 100 integers $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_{100}$  , where the sum of any five of them is always 20. Our task is to determine which of the following statements is true:

- (A) The largest $x_i$  equals 5;
- (B) The smallest $x_i$  equals 3;
- (C) $x_{17} = x_{83}$  ;
- (D) None of the foregoing statements is true.

We need to explore the implications of this condition and evaluate each option systematically.

### Step 1: Understanding the Condition

The problem states that for any selection of five distinct integers from the set $\{ x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_{100} \}$  , their sum is exactly 20. This is a strong constraint, suggesting that the integers may be highly uniform or follow a specific pattern. Since there are 100 integers, and we’re dealing with combinations of five, let’s first consider the total sum of all $x_i$  to gain insight.

Define the total sum as: $S = x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_{100}$

The number of ways to choose 5 integers out of 100 is given by the binomial coefficient: $\binom{100}{5} = \frac{100!}{5! \cdot 95!}$

Since the sum of each such group of five is 20, the total sum of all possible 5-element subset sums is: $20 \cdot \binom{100}{5}$

Now, consider how many times each $x_i$  appears in these subsets. For a fixed $x_i$  , it is included in all 5-element subsets that contain it. To form such a subset, choose $x_i$  and then select 4 more from the remaining 99 integers: $\binom{99}{4} = \frac{99!}{4! \cdot 95!}$

Thus, in the sum of all 5-element subset sums, each $x_i$  is counted $\binom{99}{4}$  times. The total sum of all 5-element subsets can also be expressed as: $\sum_{i=1}^{100} x_i \cdot \binom{99}{4} = S \cdot \binom{99}{4}$

Equating the two expressions: $S \cdot \binom{99}{4} = 20 \cdot \binom{100}{5}$

Solve for $S$  : $S = \frac{20 \cdot \binom{100}{5}}{\binom{99}{4}}$

Compute the ratio of the binomial coefficients: $\frac{\binom{100}{5}}{\binom{99}{4}} = \frac{\frac{100!}{5! \cdot 95!}}{\frac{99!}{4! \cdot 95!}} = \frac{100!}{5!} \cdot \frac{4!}{99!} = \frac{100!}{99!} \cdot \frac{4!}{5!} = 100 \cdot \frac{4!}{5 \cdot 4!} = \frac{100}{5} = 20$

So: $S = 20 \cdot 20 = 400$

The total sum of all 100 integers is 400, and the average is: $\frac{400}{100} = 4$

This suggests that if all $x_i$  were equal to 4, the sum of any five would be $5 \cdot 4 = 20$  , which satisfies the condition. But is this the only possibility? Let’s investigate further.

### Step 2: Are All xi x\_i Equal?

To test whether all $x_i$  must be 4, suppose they are not all equal. If there exist $x_i$  and $x_j$  such that $x_i \neq x_j$  , the strict condition that every set of five sums to 20 might force consistency across all values.

Consider two subsets of five integers that differ by one element. Let $S = \{ x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5 \}$  with sum 20, and replace $x_5$  with $x_6$  (where $x_6$  is not in $S$  ) to form $S' = \{ x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_6 \}$  , also with sum 20: $x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + x_5 = 20$  $x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + x_6 = 20$

Subtract the equations: $(x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + x_5) - (x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + x_6) = 20 - 20$  $x_5 - x_6 = 0$  $x_5 = x_6$

Since $x_6$  was any integer not in $S$  , this suggests that all $x_i$  outside $S$  equal $x_5$  . Now, apply this to any pair. For any $x_i$  and $x_j$  (where $i \neq j$  ), pick a subset of five including $x_i$  but not $x_j$  , e.g., $\{ x_i, x_k, x_l, x_m, x_n \}$  (where $k, l, m, n$  differ from $i$  and $j$  ), summing to 20. Replace $x_i$  with $x_j$  : $x_i + x_k + x_l + x_m + x_n = 20$  $x_j + x_k + x_l + x_m + x_n = 20$

Subtract: $x_i - x_j = 0$  $x_i = x_j$

With 100 integers, we can always form such subsets (since choosing 4 others from 98 remaining is feasible). This implies all $x_i$  are equal. If all $x_i = c$  , then for any five: $5c = 20$  $c = 4$

The total sum is $100 \cdot 4 = 400$  , matching our calculation. This strongly indicates that $x_i = 4$  for all $i$  is not just a solution but the only solution among integers.

### Step 3: Verify Alternative Configurations

Could there be a set where not all $x_i$  are 4? Suppose some $x_i = 5$  and others adjust to maintain the sum. If $x_1 = 5$  , then any five including $x_1$  sum to 20, so the other four sum to 15. But if all others were 4, four of them sum to 16, exceeding 20 when including $x_1$  (21). Adjusting some to 3, say 96 at 4 and 4 at 3, gives: $96 \cdot 4 + 4 \cdot 3 = 384 + 12 = 396$  Five 4’s sum to 20, but one 3 and four 4’s sum to 19, contradicting the condition. Any deviation seems to break the uniformity, reinforcing that all must be 4.

### Step 4: Evaluate the Options

- **(A) The largest $x_i$  equals 5**: If all $x_i = 4$  , the largest is 4, not 5. False.
- **(B) The smallest $x_i$  equals 3**: The smallest is 4, not 3. False.
- **(C) $x_{17} = x_{83}$** : Since all $x_i = 4$  , $x_{17} = 4 = x_{83}$  . True.
- **(D) None of the foregoing statements is true**: Since (C) is true, (D) is false.

---

### Conclusion

The condition forces all $x_i = 4$  , making (C) true and others false. The answer is (C). https://grok.com/chat/3c063c4e-89eb-4bf8-93ac-bb911f69b064
