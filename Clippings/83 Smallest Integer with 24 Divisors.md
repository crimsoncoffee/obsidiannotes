To determine the smallest positive integer $n$  with exactly 24 divisors (where 1 and $n$  are included as divisors), we need to find a number whose number of divisors, based on its prime factorization, equals 24, and among all such numbers, identify the smallest one. The options provided are 420, 240, 360, and 480, but we must ensure we find the smallest possible $n$  that satisfies the condition, considering the options as a guide.

### Understanding the Number of Divisors

For a positive integer $n$  with prime factorization $n = p_1^{a_1} p_2^{a_2} \dots p_k^{a_k}$  , where $p_i$  are distinct primes and $a_i$  are their exponents, the number of divisors is given by:

$$
(a_1 + 1)(a_2 + 1) \dots (a_k + 1)
$$

We need this product to equal 24. Since 24 can be factored in various ways (e.g., $24 = 24$  , $12 \times 2$  , $8 \times 3$  , $6 \times 4$  , $4 \times 3 \times 2$  ), we explore different forms of $n$  by assigning exponents to primes such that the product of $(a_i + 1)$  terms is 24, aiming to minimize $n$  by using the smallest possible primes and optimal exponent distributions.

### Step 1: Evaluate the Given Options

Let’s compute the number of divisors for each option to identify which satisfy the condition, then compare their values.

- **Option (B): 240**
	- Factorize: $240 = 2^4 \times 3^1 \times 5^1$ 
		- $2^4$  : 4 factors of 2
		- $240 \div 16 = 15$
		- $15 = 3^1 \times 5^1$
	- Number of divisors: $(4 + 1)(1 + 1)(1 + 1) = 5 \times 2 \times 2 = 20$
	- Since 20 ≠ 24, 240 does not have exactly 24 divisors.
- **Option (C): 360**
	- Factorize: $360 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5^1$ 
		- $360 \div 2 = 180$  , $180 \div 2 = 90$  , $90 \div 2 = 45$
		- $45 = 3^2 \times 5^1$  ( $45 \div 9 = 5$  )
	- Number of divisors: $(3 + 1)(2 + 1)(1 + 1) = 4 \times 3 \times 2 = 24$
	- 360 has exactly 24 divisors.
- **Option (A): 420**
	- Factorize: $420 = 2^2 \times 3^1 \times 5^1 \times 7^1$ 
		- $420 \div 2 = 210$  , $210 \div 2 = 105$
		- $105 = 3 \times 35$  , $35 = 5 \times 7$
	- Number of divisors: $(2 + 1)(1 + 1)(1 + 1)(1 + 1) = 3 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 = 24$
	- 420 has exactly 24 divisors.
- **Option (D): 480**
	- Factorize: $480 = 2^5 \times 3^1 \times 5^1$ 
		- $480 \div 2^5 = 480 \div 32 = 15$
		- $15 = 3^1 \times 5^1$
	- Number of divisors: $(5 + 1)(1 + 1)(1 + 1) = 6 \times 2 \times 2 = 24$
	- 480 has exactly 24 divisors.

Among the options, 240 has 20 divisors and does not satisfy the requirement, while 360, 420, and 480 each have exactly 24 divisors. Numerically, 360 < 420 < 480, so 360 is the smallest of these three.

### Step 2: Is There a Smaller Number with 24 Divisors?

Since the question asks for the *smallest* positive integer with 24 divisors, we should verify if a number less than 360 (and not among the options) could have exactly 24 divisors, especially since 240 (smaller than 360) was an option but failed the condition.

To minimize $n$  , we use the smallest primes (2, 3, 5, etc.) and assign exponents so that $(a_1 + 1)(a_2 + 1) \dots = 24$  , favoring higher exponents on smaller primes to keep the product small.

#### Possible Factorizations of 24

- **One prime**: $24 = 24$ 
	- $a_1 + 1 = 24$  , $a_1 = 23$
	- $n = 2^{23} \approx 8,388,608$
	- Much larger than 360.
- **Two primes**: $24 = 12 \times 2$ 
	- $(a_1 + 1) = 12$  , $(a_2 + 1) = 2$
	- $a_1 = 11$  , $a_2 = 1$
	- $n = 2^{11} \times 3^1 = 2048 \times 3 = 6144 > 360$
- **Two primes**: $24 = 8 \times 3$ 
	- $a_1 = 7$  , $a_2 = 2$
	- $n = 2^7 \times 3^2 = 128 \times 9 = 1152 > 360$
- **Two primes**: $24 = 6 \times 4$ 
	- $a_1 = 5$  , $a_2 = 3$
	- $n = 2^5 \times 3^3 = 32 \times 27 = 864 > 360$
- **Three primes**: $24 = 4 \times 3 \times 2$ 
	- $a_1 = 3$  , $a_2 = 2$  , $a_3 = 1$
	- $n = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5^1 = 8 \times 9 \times 5 = 360$
	- This matches option (C).
- **Four primes**: $24 = 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 3$ 
	- $a_1 = 1$  , $a_2 = 1$  , $a_3 = 1$  , $a_4 = 2$
	- $n = 2^1 \times 3^1 \times 5^1 \times 7^2 = 2 \times 3 \times 5 \times 49 = 1470 > 360$

#### Testing Smaller Candidates

- $n = 2^4 \times 3^2 = 144$  : $5 \times 3 = 15 < 24$
- $n = 2^3 \times 3^1 \times 5^1 = 120$  : $4 \times 2 \times 2 = 16 < 24$
- $n = 2^2 \times 3^2 \times 5^1 = 180$  : $3 \times 3 \times 2 = 18 < 24$
- $n = 2^1 \times 3^1 \times 5^1 \times 7^1 = 210$  : $2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 = 16 < 24$
- $n = 2^4 \times 3^1 \times 5^1 = 240$  : $5 \times 2 \times 2 = 20 < 24$  (as above)
- $n = 2^5 \times 3^2 = 288$  : $6 \times 3 = 18 < 24$
- $n = 2^2 \times 3^1 \times 5^2 = 300$  : $3 \times 2 \times 3 = 18 < 24$

Numbers below 360 with fewer or different prime factors consistently yield fewer than 24 divisors unless exponents are increased, which increases $n$  beyond 360 (e.g., $2^5 \times 3^3 = 864$  ).

### Conclusion

The form $n = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5^1 = 360$  uses the smallest primes with exponents 3, 2, 1, yielding exactly 24 divisors and appears minimal. Alternatives with two primes (e.g., $2^5 \times 3^3 = 864$  ) or other three-prime combinations with larger primes (e.g., $2^3 \times 3^2 \times 7^1 = 504$  ) are larger. Four or more primes increase $n$  further (e.g., 420, 1470). No number below 360 consistently achieves 24 divisors with smaller primes and suitable exponents.

Among the options—420, 240, 360, 480—only 360, 420, and 480 have 24 divisors, and 360 is the smallest. Given the question’s intent and the options, 360 is the answer.
