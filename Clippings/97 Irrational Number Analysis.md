Let’s dive into this problem step-by-step. We’re tasked with determining which statement about the number $x = 0.101001000100001\ldots + 0.272727\ldots$  is true from the given options:

- (A) $x$  is irrational
- (B) $x$  is rational but $\sqrt{x}$  is irrational
- (C) $x$  is a root of $x^2 + 0.27x + 1 = 0$
- (D) $x$  satisfies none of the above properties

### Step 1: Analyze the Two Parts of x x

First, let’s break down $x$  into its two components and determine their nature—rational or irrational.

#### The Second Part: 0.272727… 0.272727\\ldots

This decimal repeats the block "27" indefinitely, starting right after the decimal point:  
$0.272727\ldots = 0.\overline{27}$  
To confirm it’s rational, convert it to a fraction. Let:  
$y = 0.272727\ldots$  
Multiply by 100 (since the repeating block is 2 digits long):  
$100y = 27.272727\ldots$  
Subtract the original equation:  
$100y - y = 27.272727\ldots - 0.272727\ldots$  
$99y = 27$  
$y = \frac{27}{99}$  
Simplify by dividing numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, 9:  
$y = \frac{27 \div 9}{99 \div 9} = \frac{3}{11}$  
Since $\frac{3}{11}$  is a ratio of integers, $0.272727\ldots$  is rational. This matches our expectation for a repeating decimal.

#### The First Part: 0.101001000100001… 0.101001000100001\\ldots

Now, examine $0.101001000100001\ldots$  . Write out the digits to spot the pattern:

- Position 1: 1
- Position 2: 0
- Position 3: 1
- Positions 4–5: 00
- Position 6: 1
- Positions 7–9: 000
- Position 10: 1
- Positions 11–14: 0000
- Position 15: 1
- And so on…

The 1s appear at positions 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, …, with the number of zeros between them increasing by 1 each time: 1 zero, 2 zeros, 3 zeros, 4 zeros, etc. These positions are the triangular numbers, $n(n+1)/2$  , where $n = 1, 2, 3, 4, \ldots$  :

- $1 = 1 \cdot 2 / 2$
- $3 = 2 \cdot 3 / 2$
- $6 = 3 \cdot 4 / 2$
- $10 = 4 \cdot 5 / 2$
- $15 = 5 \cdot 6 / 2$

This can be expressed as a series:  
$0.101001000100001\ldots = \sum_{n=1}^\infty 10^{-n(n+1)/2}$  
For example:

- $10^{-1} = 0.1$
- $10^{-3} = 0.001$
- $10^{-6} = 0.000001$
- $10^{-10} = 0.0000000001$

Is this rational? A number is rational if its decimal expansion terminates or repeats with a fixed period. Here, the gaps between 1s grow indefinitely (1, 2, 3, … zeros), so the pattern never settles into a fixed, repeating block. This lack of periodicity suggests irrationality, akin to numbers like $0.110001000000000000000001\ldots$  (Liouville’s constant), which are constructed to be irrational. Thus, $0.101001000100001\ldots$  is irrational.

### Step 2: Compute the Nature of x x

So, we have:

- $0.101001000100001\ldots$  : irrational
- $0.272727\ldots = \frac{3}{11}$  : rational
- $x = 0.101001000100001\ldots + \frac{3}{11}$

What happens when you add an irrational number to a rational number? Suppose $x$  were rational, say $x = \frac{p}{q}$  , and $\frac{3}{11} = \frac{r}{s}$  (here, $r = 3$  , $s = 11$  ). Then:  
$0.101001000100001\ldots = x - \frac{3}{11} = \frac{p}{q} - \frac{r}{s}$  
With a common denominator:  
$\frac{p}{q} - \frac{r}{s} = \frac{ps - rq}{qs}$  
Since $ps - rq$  and $qs$  are integers, $\frac{ps - rq}{qs}$  is rational. But this contradicts the irrationality of $0.101001000100001\ldots$  . Thus, $x$  must be irrational. Generally, the sum of an irrational number and a rational number is irrational, as the rational shift doesn’t align the digits into a repeating pattern.

### Step 3: Evaluate the Options

- **(A) $x$  is irrational**: Based on our conclusion, this is true.
- **(B) $x$  is rational but $\sqrt{x}$  is irrational**: Since $x$  is irrational, this is false— $x$  isn’t rational to begin with.
- **(C) $x$  is a root of $x^2 + 0.27x + 1 = 0$** : Check the quadratic’s roots:  
	Coefficients: $a = 1$  , $b = 0.27 = \frac{27}{100}$  , $c = 1$  . Discriminant:  
	$\Delta = b^2 - 4ac = \left(\frac{27}{100}\right)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 1 = \frac{729}{10000} - 4 = \frac{729 - 40000}{10000} = \frac{-39271}{10000} < 0$  
	Since $\Delta < 0$  , the roots are complex ( $x = \frac{-0.27 \pm i \sqrt{3.9271}}{2}$  ). But $x$  , being a sum of positive decimals, is real and positive ( $x > \frac{3}{11} \approx 0.2727$  ). Thus, $x$  isn’t a root, making (C) false.
- **(D) $x$  satisfies none of the above properties**: Since (A) is true, (D) is false.

### Final Verification

Could $x$  be rational if the decimals somehow align? Adding them digit-wise (e.g., 0.101 + 0.2727… = 0.373727… with carries adjusting as zeros increase) still shows no fixed period due to the growing gaps, reinforcing that $x$  is irrational. Option (A) stands.

**Answer**: (A) $x$  is irrational

could there be easier method to identify in a fast paced exam

Yes, there could definitely be an easier and faster method to determine which statement about $x = 0.101001000100001\ldots + 0.272727\ldots$  is true in a fast-paced exam. Here's a streamlined approach that leverages key mathematical properties without getting bogged down in detailed calculations:

### Quick Method

1. **Analyze $0.272727\ldots$**  
	This is a repeating decimal ( $0.\overline{27}$  ). Repeating decimals are always rational. To confirm quickly, note that it repeats every two digits. You could convert it to a fraction (e.g., let $y = 0.272727\ldots$  , then $100y = 27.272727\ldots$  , subtract to get $99y = 27$  , so $y = \frac{3}{11}$  ), but in an exam, recognizing it as rational is enough.
2. **Examine $0.101001000100001\ldots$**  
	Look at the pattern: '1's appear with an increasing number of zeros between them (0 zeros, 1 zero, 2 zeros, 3 zeros, etc.). This doesn't form a fixed repeating block because the gaps keep growing. A decimal is rational only if it terminates or repeats with a fixed period after some point. Since this neither terminates nor repeats periodically, it’s irrational.
3. **Determine the Nature of $x$**  
	Now, $x$  is the sum of a rational number ( $\frac{3}{11}$  ) and an irrational number ( $0.101001000100001\ldots$  ). A key property to recall: **the sum of a rational number and an irrational number is always irrational**. This is because if the sum were rational, subtracting the rational part would leave the other part rational, contradicting its irrationality.
4. **Evaluate the Options Quickly**
	- **(A) $x$  is irrational**: Based on step 3, this is true.
	- **(B) $x$  is rational but $\sqrt{x}$  is irrational**: Since $x$  is irrational, this is false (it assumes $x$  is rational).
	- **(C) $x$  is a root of $x^2 + 0.27x + 1 = 0$** : Check the discriminant of the quadratic: $b^2 - 4ac = (0.27)^2 - 4(1)(1) = 0.0729 - 4 = -3.9271 < 0$  . Negative discriminant means complex roots, but $x$  is real and positive, so this is false.
	- **(D) $x$  satisfies none of the above**: Since (A) is true, this is false.
5. **Conclusion**  
	Option (A) is the correct choice, and you can stop here in a time crunch.

### Why This is Faster

- **No Detailed Addition**: You don’t need to add the decimals digit by digit to check the pattern of $x$  .
- **Leverage Properties**: Use the rational + irrational = irrational rule instead of analyzing the sum’s decimal expansion.
- **Quick Discriminant Check**: For option (C), a fast discriminant calculation rules it out without solving the quadratic fully.

This method takes advantage of recognizing patterns and applying number properties directly, which is ideal for a fast-paced exam where time is limited. You’d likely reach the answer in under a minute! https://grok.com/chat/d493b457-a46a-4ddc-8098-60d9f51d604e
