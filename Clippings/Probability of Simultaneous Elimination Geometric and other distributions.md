Let’s dive into this probability problem with a clear and structured approach. We’re tasked with finding the probability that three participants in a competition, each with a probability $p$  of completing a task in any given round, are all eliminated in the same round. If a participant fails the task (with probability $1 - p$  ), they are eliminated, and the competition continues indefinitely until each participant is eliminated. Since the participants act independently, we need to determine the likelihood that their elimination rounds coincide.

### Step 1: Understanding Elimination for a Single Participant

Consider one participant. In each round, they attempt the task:

- **Probability of success (continuing):** $p$
- **Probability of failure (elimination):** $1 - p$

The participant continues until they fail. Let’s define $X$  as the round in which a participant is eliminated. We can calculate the probability of elimination in a specific round $k$  (where $k = 1, 2, 3, \ldots$  ):

- **Round 1:** Fails immediately, $P(X = 1) = 1 - p$  .
- **Round 2:** Succeeds in round 1, fails in round 2, $P(X = 2) = p \cdot (1 - p)$  .
- **Round 3:** Succeeds in rounds 1 and 2, fails in round 3, $P(X = 3) = p^2 \cdot (1 - p)$  .

Generally, for elimination in round $k$  , the participant succeeds in the first $k-1$  rounds and fails in round $k$  : $P(X = k) = p^{k-1} \cdot (1 - p)$  This is a geometric distribution, where $X$  represents the number of trials until the first “success” (failure, in this context), with “success” probability $1 - p$  . Let’s verify it sums to 1 over all rounds: $\sum_{k=1}^\infty p^{k-1} \cdot (1 - p) = (1 - p) \sum_{k=0}^\infty p^k = (1 - p) \cdot \frac{1}{1 - p} = 1$  (assuming $0 < p < 1$  ), which confirms it’s a valid probability distribution.

### Step 2: Three Participants and the Same Elimination Round

Now, we have three participants, each with elimination round $X_1, X_2, X_3$  , all independent and following the same geometric distribution: $P(X_i = k) = p^{k-1} \cdot (1 - p)$  We need the probability that $X_1 = X_2 = X_3$  , meaning all three are eliminated in the same round, say round $k$  . For a specific round $k$  : $P(X_1 = k, X_2 = k, X_3 = k) = P(X_1 = k) \cdot P(X_2 = k) \cdot P(X_3 = k)$  $= [p^{k-1} \cdot (1 - p)]^3 = p^{3(k-1)} \cdot (1 - p)^3$  This is the probability they’re all eliminated in round $k$  . Since they could be eliminated together in any round ( $k = 1, 2, 3, \ldots$  ), we sum over all possible rounds: $P(X_1 = X_2 = X_3) = \sum_{k=1}^\infty p^{3(k-1)} \cdot (1 - p)^3$

### Step 3: Evaluating the Infinite Sum

Factor out the constant $(1 - p)^3$  : $P = (1 - p)^3 \sum_{k=1}^\infty p^{3(k-1)}$  Examine the series:

- $k = 1$  : $p^{3(1-1)} = p^0 = 1$
- $k = 2$  : $p^{3(2-1)} = p^3$
- $k = 3$  : $p^{3(3-1)} = p^6$

So: $\sum_{k=1}^\infty p^{3(k-1)} = p^0 + p^3 + p^6 + \cdots = \sum_{m=0}^\infty (p^3)^m$  This is a geometric series with first term 1 and common ratio $p^3$  . Assuming $0 < p < 1$  , $|p^3| < 1$  , and the sum is: $\sum_{m=0}^\infty (p^3)^m = \frac{1}{1 - p^3}$  Thus: $P = (1 - p)^3 \cdot \frac{1}{1 - p^3} = \frac{(1 - p)^3}{1 - p^3}$

### Step 4: Verification with Examples

- **$p = 0.5$  :**  
	$\frac{(1 - 0.5)^3}{1 - (0.5)^3} = \frac{0.5^3}{1 - 0.125} = \frac{0.125}{0.875} = \frac{1}{7} \approx 0.1429$  
	Check: $P(k) = (0.5)^{3k}$  , sum $\sum_{k=1}^\infty (0.5)^{3k} = 0.125 + 0.015625 + \cdots = \frac{0.125}{1 - 0.125} = \frac{1}{7}$  , matches.
- **$p \to 0$  :**  
	$\frac{(1 - 0)^3}{1 - 0^3} = \frac{1}{1} = 1$  , logical since all fail in round 1.
- **$p \to 1$  :**  
	$\frac{(1 - 1)^3}{1 - 1^3} \to \frac{0}{0}$  , but limit as $p \to 1^-$  is 0, consistent with never failing.

### Step 5: Matching the Options

The calculated probability $\frac{(1 - p)^3}{1 - p^3}$  matches option (a). Other options:

- (b) $\frac{1}{3}(1 - p)$  : For $p = 0.5$  , $\frac{1}{3} \cdot 0.5 \approx 0.1667 \neq \frac{1}{7}$  .
- (c) $p^3$  : For $p = 0.5$  , $0.125 \neq \frac{1}{7}$  ; for $p = 0$  , $0 \neq 1$  .

The note about “probability given as 9” seems to be a typo (possibly a problem number). Based on the derivation, the answer is:

**Final Answer:** $\frac{(1 - p)^3}{1 - p^3}$  , corresponding to option (a).

any other intuitive way I could have arrived at the same

---

Let’s dive into finding an intuitive way to calculate the probability that three independent participants in a competition are all eliminated in the same round, beyond the direct summation method that leads to $\frac{(1 - p)^3}{1 - p^3}$  . Each participant has a probability $p$  of succeeding in a round (and thus continuing) and $1 - p$  of failing (and thus being eliminated), and their fates are decided independently each round. We’re looking for a fresh, conceptual perspective that feels natural and avoids getting bogged down in infinite series right away, if possible.

### A New Intuitive Angle: Thinking About the "Deciding Round"

Imagine the competition unfolding round by round. At some point, all three participants will be eliminated—it’s inevitable since $1 - p > 0$  . What we care about is the chance that, whenever the *last* of the three is eliminated, the other two are also eliminated in that exact same round. This suggests focusing on the round where the group’s fate is sealed together, leveraging their independence in a way that feels less like tracking every possible round and more like capturing the essence of the event.

Let’s define the elimination round for each participant:

- For Participant 1, let $X_1$  be the round where they fail. The probability they fail in round $k$  is $P(X_1 = k) = p^{k-1} (1 - p)$  , because they succeed ( $p$  ) for $k-1$  rounds and then fail ( $1 - p$  ).
- Similarly, for Participants 2 and 3, define $X_2$  and $X_3$  , with the same probability distribution, and all $X_i$  ’s are independent.

The event “all three are eliminated in the same round” means $X_1 = X_2 = X_3$  . But instead of summing over all possible rounds directly, let’s flip our perspective: consider the *latest* elimination round among the three and ask what’s the chance all three align there.

Define $M = \max(X_1, X_2, X_3)$  , the round when the last participant is eliminated. We want the probability that all three $X_i$  ’s equal $M$  —that is, no one is eliminated before the round when the final participant drops out. This is a bit tricky because $M$  depends on $X_1, X_2, X_3$  , so let’s rethink this intuitively without diving too deep into distributions just yet.

### Reframing with a "Reset" Idea

Here’s a different tack: picture the process as a series of “trials” where we check if all three fail together, and if not, we kind of “reset” among those still in play—but since they’re independent, each round is a fresh shot at this. In round 1, all three could fail together with probability $(1 - p)^3$  . If that doesn’t happen, some survive, and we check again in round 2 among the survivors. This feels recursive, but let’s simplify by focusing on the independence and the pattern.

For all three to be eliminated in, say, round $k$  :

- They must all survive the first $k-1$  rounds: probability $p^{k-1}$  per participant, so $(p^{k-1})^3 = p^{3(k-1)}$  for all three.
- Then, in round $k$  , they all fail: probability $(1 - p)^3$  .

So, the chance they’re all out in round $k$  is $p^{3(k-1)} (1 - p)^3$  . This matches the standard approach, and summing it gives a geometric series. But can we intuit the total probability differently?

### A Complementary Insight: The "All or Nothing" Threshold

Let’s try a threshold idea. Imagine waiting for the first round where all three fail *simultaneously*. Up until that round, they’ve all been surviving together, and then—bam—they all drop out. The number of rounds until this happens is like a waiting time:

- In each round, given they’ve all survived so far, the chance all three fail is $(1 - p)^3$  .
- The chance they all survive a round is $p^3$  .

This resembles a geometric random variable: the number of trials until the first “success” (here, “success” is all three failing), where the success probability is $(1 - p)^3$  and the “failure” (all surviving) is $p^3$  . The probability that the first round $k$  is when they all fail, having survived $k-1$  rounds, is: $P(\text{all fail in round } k) = (p^3)^{k-1} (1 - p)^3$  Sum this: $P = \sum_{k=1}^\infty (p^3)^{k-1} (1 - p)^3$  This is a geometric series starting at $k=1$  :

- First term: $(1 - p)^3$  when $k=1$  .
- Common ratio: $p^3$  .
- Sum: $(1 - p)^3 \cdot \frac{1}{1 - p^3} = \frac{(1 - p)^3}{1 - p^3}$  .

This aligns perfectly with the known result! Intuitively, it’s as if we’re waiting for that one round where all three stars align to fail, and their independence makes each round a clean shot at $(1 - p)^3$  conditioned on prior joint survival.

### Why This Feels Intuitive

This “waiting for simultaneous failure” perspective skips tracking individual eliminations and zooms in on the collective event. It leverages the symmetry and independence: no matter which round we’re in, if all three are still standing, there’s a $(1 - p)^3$  chance they all fall together, adjusted by how long they’ve all hung on ( $(p^3)^{k-1}$  ). It’s less about following each participant and more about the group hitting a collective wall.

### Double-Checking

- If $p = 0$  : $(1 - 0)^3 / (1 - 0^3) = 1 / 1 = 1$  , all fail in round 1—makes sense.
- If $p = 1$  : $(1 - 1)^3 / (1 - 1^3) = 0 / 0$  , undefined, but intuitively 0 since they never fail—consistent.

This approach offers a fresh lens, complementing the round-by-round summation by framing it as a single event we’re waiting for, making the math emerge naturally from the story of the competition.

So, an intuitive alternative is to think of the probability as the expected outcome of waiting for the first round where all three fail together, leading us to $\frac{(1 - p)^3}{1 - p^3}$  through a geometric waiting-time intuition.

give me all such distributions and when to spot them

---

Let’s explore the probability distributions that arise in scenarios involving independent events, particularly those related to waiting times, successes, or specific occurrences in repeated trials. Below, I’ll outline the key distributions, explain what they represent, and provide guidance on when to spot them in problems. This will equip you with a clear framework to recognize and apply these distributions effectively.

---

### 1\. Geometric Distribution

- **What it is:** The geometric distribution models the number of trials needed until the first “success” occurs in a sequence of independent Bernoulli trials (each trial has two outcomes: success or failure), where the success probability is $p$  .
- **Key Formula:**  
	$P(X = k) = (1 - p)^{k-1} p$  , where $X$  is the number of trials until the first success, and $k = 1, 2, 3, \dots$  .
- **When to Spot it:**  
	Look for scenarios where you’re waiting for an event to happen for the first time in repeated, independent attempts. Examples include:
	- Number of coin flips until the first heads.
	- Number of attempts until a machine breaks down.
	- Rounds until a participant is eliminated in a game.
- **Key Characteristics:**
	- Discrete trials.
	- Focus on the *first* occurrence of an event.
	- Independence between trials.

---

### 2\. Joint Geometric Distributions

- **What it is:** This occurs when you have multiple independent geometric random variables, each representing the waiting time until a success for different processes.
- **Key Insight:**  
	If $X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n$  are independent geometric random variables (each with success probability $p$  ), their joint behavior can be analyzed by multiplying their individual probabilities due to independence.
- **When to Spot it:**  
	Look for problems involving several independent entities, each waiting for its own first success. Examples include:
	- Multiple machines failing independently at different times.
	- Several players being eliminated in a game, each on their own timeline.
	- Independent sensors detecting an event at varying trials.
- **Key Characteristics:**
	- Multiple processes running in parallel.
	- Each follows a geometric distribution.
	- Independence allows joint probabilities to be computed as products.

---

### 3\. Geometric Distribution for Simultaneous Events

- **What it is:** A special case where you’re interested in the probability that multiple independent geometric processes all “succeed” (e.g., fail) in the same trial for the first time.
- **Key Formula:**  
	For $n$  independent processes with success probability $p$  , the probability they all succeed on trial $k$  is:  
	$P(X_1 = k, X_2 = k, \dots, X_n = k) = [(1 - p)^{k-1} p]^n$  .
- **When to Spot it:**  
	Look for scenarios where all independent events must occur together in the same trial. Examples include:
	- All participants in a game being eliminated in the same round.
	- Multiple systems failing simultaneously after functioning perfectly.
	- All players losing at the same time in a competition.
- **Key Characteristics:**
	- Simultaneous success across all processes.
	- Still rooted in geometric waiting times.
	- Often requires summing over all possible trials (see geometric series below).

---

### 4\. Negative Binomial Distribution

- **What it is:** A generalization of the geometric distribution, it models the number of trials needed until the $r$  \-th success occurs in a sequence of independent Bernoulli trials with success probability $p$  .
- **Key Formula:**  
	$P(X = k) = \binom{k-1}{r-1} p^r (1 - p)^{k-r}$  , where $X$  is the trial number of the $r$  \-th success, and $k = r, r+1, r+2, \dots$  .
- **When to Spot it:**  
	Look for scenarios where you’re waiting for a specific number of successes (more than one), not just the first. Examples include:
	- Number of coin flips until you get 3 heads.
	- Number of sales calls until the 5th sale.
	- Trials until a team wins 2 games.
- **Key Characteristics:**
	- Extends the geometric distribution ( $r = 1$  is geometric).
	- Counts trials up to the $r$  \-th success.
	- Independent trials with constant $p$  .

---

### 5\. Exponential Distribution

- **What it is:** The continuous counterpart to the geometric distribution, it models the time until the first event in a Poisson process (a process where events occur randomly over continuous time) with rate $\lambda$  .
- **Key Formula:**  
	Probability density function: $f(t) = \lambda e^{-\lambda t}$  for $t \geq 0$  .  
	Cumulative distribution: $P(T \leq t) = 1 - e^{-\lambda t}$  .
- **When to Spot it:**  
	Look for continuous waiting time problems where events occur randomly and independently over time. Examples include:
	- Time until a radioactive particle decays.
	- Time until the next customer arrives at a store.
	- Time until a machine fails in a continuous operation.
- **Key Characteristics:**
	- Continuous time (not discrete trials).
	- Memoryless property (like the geometric distribution).
	- Linked to Poisson processes.

---

### 6\. Poisson Distribution

- **What it is:** Models the number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space, given an average rate of occurrence $\lambda$  , when events are independent and random.
- **Key Formula:**  
	$P(X = k) = \frac{\lambda^k e^{-\lambda}}{k!}$  , where $X$  is the number of events, and $k = 0, 1, 2, \dots$  .
- **When to Spot it:**  
	Look for problems counting occurrences over a fixed period or area, not waiting times. Examples include:
	- Number of emails received in an hour.
	- Number of defects in a meter of fabric.
	- Number of cars passing a point in 10 minutes.
- **Key Characteristics:**
	- Focuses on counts, not timing of individual events.
	- Assumes independence and a constant average rate.
	- Discrete outcomes over a continuous interval.

---

### 7\. Geometric Series (for Summing Probabilities)

- **What it is:** Not a distribution itself, but a mathematical tool often used with geometric or related distributions to sum probabilities over all possible trials (infinite series).
- **Key Formula:**  
	$\sum_{k=1}^\infty r^{k-1} = \frac{1}{1 - r}$  for $|r| < 1$  .
- **When to Spot it:**  
	Look for problems requiring the total probability of an event occurring across all possible times. Examples include:
	- Total probability that multiple processes succeed in the same round (summed over all rounds).
	- Expected value or total probability in infinite trial scenarios.
	- “Eventually” occurring events in repeated trials.
- **Key Characteristics:**
	- Simplifies infinite sums.
	- Common in geometric and negative binomial problems.
	- Requires the ratio $r$  (e.g., $(1 - p)^n$  ) to be less than 1.

---

### Spotting These Distributions: A Practical Checklist

To identify the right distribution in a problem, use this guide:

- **Are trials independent and repeated?**
	- Yes → Consider Bernoulli-based distributions (geometric, negative binomial).
- **Is it discrete or continuous?**
	- Discrete trials → Geometric or negative binomial.
	- Continuous time → Exponential.
- **Waiting for an event?**
	- First success → Geometric.
	- $r$  \-th success → Negative binomial.
	- First event in time → Exponential.
- **Multiple independent processes?**
	- Each waiting separately → Joint geometric.
	- All succeeding together → Simultaneous geometric event.
- **Counting events, not waiting?**
	- Fixed interval → Poisson.
- **Summing over all possibilities?**
	- Infinite trials → Geometric series.

---

### Summary

These distributions—geometric, joint geometric, negative binomial, exponential, and Poisson—cover a wide range of scenarios involving independent events. By recognizing whether you’re waiting for successes, counting occurrences, or analyzing simultaneous events, and noting whether the context is discrete or continuous, you can confidently select the appropriate distribution and solve the problem effectively.

and we are adding because we trying to find the pr for all the k possible rounds

---

To address your query, let's clarify why we use addition when finding the probability that all three participants are eliminated in the same round across all possible rounds $k$  .

In this scenario, we have three independent participants, each with a probability $p$  of succeeding in a round and $1 - p$  of failing. The rounds continue indefinitely until each participant is eliminated, and we want the probability that all three are eliminated in the same round—meaning there’s some round $k$  where all three fail for the first time.

For all three to be eliminated in a specific round $k$  :

- Each participant must succeed in the first $k-1$  rounds, with probability $p^{k-1}$  per participant.
- Each must then fail in round $k$  , with probability $1 - p$  .
- Since the participants are independent, the joint probability for round $k$  is:
	$$
	[p^{k-1} (1 - p)]^3 = p^{3(k-1)} (1 - p)^3
	$$

This expression, $p^{3(k-1)} (1 - p)^3$  , is the probability that all three are eliminated together in round $k$  , for a specific $k$  (e.g., $k = 1, 2, 3, \ldots$  ).

However, the problem asks for the probability that they are eliminated in the *same round*, without specifying which round. This could happen in round 1, round 2, round 3, and so on. Each of these possibilities (elimination in round $k = 1$  , $k = 2$  , etc.) is a distinct, mutually exclusive event—meaning they can’t occur simultaneously. For example, if all three are eliminated in round 1, they can’t also be eliminated in round 2.

Since these events are mutually exclusive and we want the total probability across *all possible rounds*, we add the probabilities for each $k$  :

- Probability for $k = 1$  : $p^{3(1-1)} (1 - p)^3 = (1 - p)^3$
- Probability for $k = 2$  : $p^{3(2-1)} (1 - p)^3 = p^3 (1 - p)^3$
- Probability for $k = 3$  : $p^{3(3-1)} (1 - p)^3 = p^6 (1 - p)^3$
- And so forth.

Thus, the total probability is the infinite sum:

$$
P = \sum_{k=1}^\infty p^{3(k-1)} (1 - p)^3
$$

We factor out $(1 - p)^3$  (since it’s constant):

$$
P = (1 - p)^3 \sum_{k=1}^\infty p^{3(k-1)}
$$

Now, evaluate the sum:

$$
\sum_{k=1}^\infty p^{3(k-1)} = p^0 + p^3 + p^6 + p^9 + \cdots = 1 + p^3 + p^6 + p^9 + \cdots
$$

This is a geometric series with first term 1 and common ratio $p^3$  . Since $0 < p < 1$  , $|p^3| < 1$  , and the sum of an infinite geometric series $\sum_{m=0}^\infty r^m$  is $\frac{1}{1 - r}$  , we get:

$$
\sum_{k=1}^\infty p^{3(k-1)} = \frac{1}{1 - p^3}
$$

So:

$$
P = (1 - p)^3 \cdot \frac{1}{1 - p^3} = \frac{(1 - p)^3}{1 - p^3}
$$

**Why addition?** We add because we’re accounting for all possible rounds $k$  where this event could occur. Each term $p^{3(k-1)} (1 - p)^3$  represents the probability for a specific round, and since the event “all eliminated in round $k$  ” can only happen in one round (not multiple rounds at once), we sum over all $k$  to cover every possibility.

This makes sense intuitively:

- If $p = 0$  , all fail in round 1, so $P = \frac{1^3}{1 - 0} = 1$  , which is correct.
- If $p = 0.5$  , $P = \frac{(0.5)^3}{1 - (0.5)^3} = \frac{0.125}{0.875} = \frac{1}{7}$  , a reasonable probability that decreases as rounds progress.

Thus, we add the probabilities for each $k$  because we’re finding the total probability across all mutually exclusive scenarios where the three participants are eliminated together.

in the response before above I want you to give all the formulas and how to approach for all the distributions you showed

---

Here’s a comprehensive guide to the probability distributions mentioned—Geometric, Negative Binomial, Exponential, and Poisson—along with their formulas and how to approach problems involving them. I’ll also include joint distributions for independent geometric variables and geometric series, as they often relate to these distributions. This will give you all the tools you need to recognize and solve problems effectively.

## 1\. Geometric Distribution

**What it is:**  
The Geometric Distribution models the number of trials needed to get the first success in a sequence of independent Bernoulli trials (each trial has a success probability $p$  ).

### Formulas:

- **Probability Mass Function (PMF):**
	$$
	P(X = k) = (1 - p)^{k-1} p \quad \text{for} \quad k = 1, 2, 3, \dots
	$$
	 $X$  is the trial number of the first success.
- **Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF):**
	$$
	P(X \leq k) = 1 - (1 - p)^k
	$$
- **Mean (Expected Value):**
	$$
	E[X] = \frac{1}{p}
	$$
- **Variance:**
	$$
	\text{Var}(X) = \frac{1 - p}{p^2}
	$$

### How to Approach:

1. **Identify the scenario:** You’re waiting for the first success in repeated, independent trials (e.g., flipping a coin until heads appears).
2. **Determine $p$  :** Find the success probability per trial.
3. **Choose the formula:**
	- Use the PMF to calculate the probability of the first success on trial $k$  .
	- Use the CDF for the probability of success by trial $k$  .
	- Use mean and variance for expected trials or variability.
4. **Apply:** Plug in $p$  and $k$  (or other variables) into the appropriate formula.

---

## 2\. Negative Binomial Distribution

**What it is:**  
The Negative Binomial Distribution models the number of trials needed to achieve a fixed number $r$  of successes in independent Bernoulli trials with success probability $p$  .

### Formulas:

- **Probability Mass Function (PMF):**
	$$
	P(X = k) = \binom{k-1}{r-1} p^r (1 - p)^{k - r} \quad \text{for} \quad k = r, r+1, r+2, \dots
	$$
	 $X$  is the trial number of the $r$  \-th success.
- **Mean (Expected Value):**
	$$
	E[X] = \frac{r}{p}
	$$
- **Variance:**
	$$
	\text{Var}(X) = \frac{r(1 - p)}{p^2}
	$$

### How to Approach:

1. **Identify the scenario:** You’re waiting for the $r$  \-th success (e.g., number of shots until the 3rd goal).
2. **Determine $r$  and $p$  :** Find the number of successes needed and the success probability.
3. **Choose the formula:**
	- Use the PMF for the probability of the $r$  \-th success on trial $k$  .
	- Use mean and variance for expected trials or spread.
4. **Apply:** Substitute $r$  , $p$  , and $k$  into the PMF, or use $r$  and $p$  for mean/variance.

---

## 3\. Exponential Distribution

**What it is:**  
The Exponential Distribution models the continuous time until the first event in a Poisson process with rate $\lambda$  (events per unit time).

### Formulas:

- **Probability Density Function (PDF):**
	$$
	f(t) = \lambda e^{-\lambda t} \quad \text{for} \quad t \geq 0
	$$
- **Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF):**
	$$
	P(T \leq t) = 1 - e^{-\lambda t}
	$$
- **Mean (Expected Value):**
	$$
	E[T] = \frac{1}{\lambda}
	$$
- **Variance:**
	$$
	\text{Var}(T) = \frac{1}{\lambda^2}
	$$

### How to Approach:

1. **Identify the scenario:** You’re measuring continuous time until an event (e.g., time until a machine fails).
2. **Determine $\lambda$  :** Find the rate (average events per unit time).
3. **Choose the formula:**
	- Use the PDF for the density at time $t$  .
	- Use the CDF for the probability of an event by time $t$  .
	- Use mean and variance for expected time or variability.
4. **Apply:** Insert $\lambda$  and $t$  into the formula, noting the memoryless property (future waiting time doesn’t depend on past waiting).

## 4\. Poisson Distribution

**What it is:**  
The Poisson Distribution models the number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space, given an average rate $\lambda$  .

### Formulas:

- **Probability Mass Function (PMF):**
	$$
	P(X = k) = \frac{\lambda^k e^{-\lambda}}{k!} \quad \text{for} \quad k = 0, 1, 2, \dots
	$$
- **Mean (Expected Value):**
	$$
	E[X] = \lambda
	$$
- **Variance:**
	$$
	\text{Var}(X) = \lambda
	$$

### How to Approach:

1. **Identify the scenario:** You’re counting events in a fixed interval (e.g., calls in an hour).
2. **Determine $\lambda$  :** Find the average number of events in the interval.
3. **Choose the formula:**
	- Use the PMF for the probability of exactly $k$  events.
	- Use mean and variance for expected count or spread.
4. **Apply:** Plug in $\lambda$  and $k$  into the PMF, or use $\lambda$  for mean/variance. For large $\lambda$  , consider a normal approximation.

## 5\. Joint Geometric Distributions

**What it is:**  
This applies when you have multiple independent geometric random variables (e.g., waiting times for separate processes).

### Formulas:

- **Joint PMF for Two Independent Geometric Variables:**  
	If $X$  (success probability $p$  ) and $Y$  (success probability $q$  ) are independent:
	$$
	P(X = k, Y = m) = P(X = k) P(Y = m) = [(1 - p)^{k-1} p] [(1 - q)^{m-1} q]
	$$

### How to Approach:

1. **Identify the scenario:** Multiple independent processes, each waiting for their first success (e.g., two machines failing independently).
2. **Determine probabilities:** Find $p$  and $q$  for each process.
3. **Choose the formula:** Use the joint PMF by multiplying individual PMFs.
4. **Apply:**
	- For specific outcomes, plug in $k$  and $m$  .
	- For events like $X = Y$  , sum the joint probabilities over all pairs where $k = m$  .

## 6\. Geometric Series

**What it is:**  
A tool for summing infinite sequences, often used in probability calculations (e.g., total probability across all trials).

### Formulas:

- **Infinite Sum (starting at $k = 0$  ):**
	$$
	\sum_{k=0}^\infty r^k = \frac{1}{1 - r} \quad \text{for} \quad |r| < 1
	$$
- **Infinite Sum (starting at $k = 1$  ):**
	$$
	\sum_{k=1}^\infty r^{k-1} = \frac{1}{1 - r}
	$$

### How to Approach:

1. **Identify the scenario:** You’re summing probabilities over infinite trials (e.g., total probability of success in a geometric process).
2. **Determine $r$  :** Find the common ratio in the series (e.g., $1 - p$  in geometric PMF sums).
3. **Check convergence:** Ensure $|r| < 1$  .
4. **Apply:** Use the formula to compute the sum, simplifying your calculation.

## Quick Reference: When to Use Each

- **Geometric:** Waiting for the first success in discrete trials.
- **Negative Binomial:** Waiting for the $r$  \-th success in discrete trials.
- **Exponential:** Waiting for the first event in continuous time.
- **Poisson:** Counting events in a fixed interval.
- **Joint Geometric:** Multiple independent waiting times.
- **Geometric Series:** Summing probabilities over infinite possibilities.

By identifying whether you’re waiting or counting, and whether time is discrete or continuous, you can pick the right distribution, apply its formulas, and solve the problem efficiently!
