To determine the probability that the second number chosen is 5, let’s carefully analyze the two-step random selection process described in the problem.

### Step 1: Understand the Selection Process

- **First Choice**: A girl chooses a number $n$  uniformly at random from the set $\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}$ . Since there are 6 numbers, each has an equal probability of being selected:
	$$
	P(n) = \frac{1}{6} \text{ for } n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
	$$
- **Second Choice**: Given she chooses $n$  , she then selects a second number uniformly at random from the set $\{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$ . The size of this set is $n$  , so each number in the set has a probability of $\frac{1}{n}$ , provided the number is within the range $\{1, \ldots, n\}$ .

### Step 2: Define the Event of Interest

We need to find the probability that the second number is 5. Let’s denote this event as $A$  . For the second number to be 5, it must be possible to select 5 from the set $\{1, \ldots, n\}$ , which depends on the value of $n$  .

### Step 3: Determine When the Second Number Can Be 5

Consider each possible value of $n$  and check if 5 is in the set $\{1, \ldots, n\}$ :

- If $n = 1$  , the set is $\{1\}$ . 5 is not included, so $P(\text{second} = 5 \mid n = 1) = 0$  .
- If $n = 2$  , the set is $\{1, 2\}$ . 5 is not included, so $P(\text{second} = 5 \mid n = 2) = 0$  .
- If $n = 3$  , the set is $\{1, 2, 3\}$ . 5 is not included, so $P(\text{second} = 5 \mid n = 3) = 0$  .
- If $n = 4$  , the set is $\{1, 2, 3, 4\}$ . 5 is not included, so $P(\text{second} = 5 \mid n = 4) = 0$  .
- If $n = 5$  , the set is $\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}$ . 5 is included, and since there are 5 numbers, $P(\text{second} = 5 \mid n = 5) = \frac{1}{5}$  .
- If $n = 6$  , the set is $\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}$ . 5 is included, and since there are 6 numbers, $P(\text{second} = 5 \mid n = 6) = \frac{1}{6}$  .

Thus, the second number can be 5 only when $n \geq 5$  , specifically when $n = 5$  or $n = 6$  . For $n < 5$  (i.e., $n = 1, 2, 3, 4$  ), the probability is 0 because 5 is not in the set.

### Step 4: Apply the Law of Total Probability

Since the value of $n$  determines the set from which the second number is chosen, we use the law of total probability to compute $P(A)$  , the probability that the second number is 5. This is the sum over all possible $n$  of the probability of choosing that $n$  times the conditional probability that the second number is 5 given that $n$  :

$$
P(\text{second} = 5) = \sum_{n=1}^{6} P(n) \cdot P(\text{second} = 5 \mid n)
$$

Substitute the known probabilities:

- $P(n) = \frac{1}{6}$  for all $n$  .
- $P(\text{second} = 5 \mid n) = 0$  for $n = 1, 2, 3, 4$  .
- $P(\text{second} = 5 \mid n = 5) = \frac{1}{5}$  .
- $P(\text{second} = 5 \mid n = 6) = \frac{1}{6}$  .

So:

$$
P(\text{second} = 5) = P(n=1) \cdot 0 + P(n=2) \cdot 0 + P(n=3) \cdot 0 + P(n=4) \cdot 0 + P(n=5) \cdot \frac{1}{5} + P(n=6) \cdot \frac{1}{6}
$$
 
$$
= 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + \left(\frac{1}{6} \cdot \frac{1}{5}\right) + \left(\frac{1}{6} \cdot \frac{1}{6}\right)
$$
 
$$
= \frac{1}{6} \cdot \frac{1}{5} + \frac{1}{6} \cdot \frac{1}{6}
$$

### Step 5: Compute the Probability

Calculate each term:

- $\frac{1}{6} \cdot \frac{1}{5} = \frac{1}{30}$
- $\frac{1}{6} \cdot \frac{1}{6} = \frac{1}{36}$

Now sum these fractions:

$$
\frac{1}{30} + \frac{1}{36}
$$

Find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 30 and 36 is 180:

- $\frac{1}{30} = \frac{1 \cdot 6}{30 \cdot 6} = \frac{6}{180}$  (since $30 \cdot 6 = 180$  )
- $\frac{1}{36} = \frac{1 \cdot 5}{36 \cdot 5} = \frac{5}{180}$  (since $36 \cdot 5 = 180$  )

Add them:

$$
\frac{6}{180} + \frac{5}{180} = \frac{6 + 5}{180} = \frac{11}{180}
$$

### Step 6: Verify the Calculation

Let’s confirm using the joint probabilities of the favorable outcomes:

- **Outcome $(n = 5, \text{second} = 5)$** : $P(n = 5, \text{second} = 5) = P(n = 5) \cdot P(\text{second} = 5 \mid n = 5) = \frac{1}{6} \cdot \frac{1}{5} = \frac{1}{30}$  .
- **Outcome $(n = 6, \text{second} = 5)$** : $P(n = 6, \text{second} = 5) = P(n = 6) \cdot P(\text{second} = 5 \mid n = 6) = \frac{1}{6} \cdot \frac{1}{6} = \frac{1}{36}$  .

Total probability:

$$
\frac{1}{30} + \frac{1}{36} = \frac{6}{180} + \frac{5}{180} = \frac{11}{180}
$$

The calculations are consistent.

### Step 7: Match with Options

The options are:

- (a) $\frac{11}{180}$
- (b) $\frac{2}{45}$
- (c) $\frac{1}{3}$
- (d) $\frac{1}{18}$

Our result, $\frac{11}{180}$ , matches option (a). To ensure correctness, note that $\frac{11}{180} \approx 0.0611$ , while $\frac{2}{45} \approx 0.0444$ , $\frac{1}{3} \approx 0.3333$ , and $\frac{1}{18} \approx 0.0556$ . Numerically, $\frac{11}{180}$ is distinct and aligns with the computation.

### Final Answer

The probability that the second number is 5 is $\frac{11}{180}$ , which corresponds to option (a). https://grok.com/chat/52a0eab0-c6bd-466a-994c-259ad6b9ea6d
