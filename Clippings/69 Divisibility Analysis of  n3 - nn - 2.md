To determine the divisibility properties of the expression $(n^3 - n)(n - 2)$ for all integers $n \geq 3$ , we need to analyze which of the given options—(A) divisible by 6 but not always by 12, (B) divisible by 12 but not always by 24, (C) divisible by 24 but not always by 48, or (D) divisible by 9—correctly describes the expression for all such $n$ .

### Step 1: Factorize the Expression

Start by simplifying $(n^3 - n)(n - 2)$ . Notice that:

$$
n^3 - n = n(n^2 - 1) = n(n - 1)(n + 1)
$$

This factorization uses the difference of squares, $n^2 - 1 = (n - 1)(n + 1)$ . Thus, the original expression becomes:

$$
(n^3 - n)(n - 2) = n(n - 1)(n + 1)(n - 2)
$$

Now, observe the terms: $n - 2$ , $n - 1$ , $n$ , and $n + 1$ . For $n \geq 3$ , these are four consecutive integers starting from $n - 2$ up to $n + 1$ . For example:

- If $n = 3$ , the terms are $1, 2, 3, 4$ .
- If $n = 4$ , they are $2, 3, 4, 5$ .
- If $n = 5$ , they are $3, 4, 5, 6$ .

The expression is therefore the product of four consecutive integers:

$$
(n - 2)(n - 1)n(n + 1)
$$

### Step 2: Analyze Divisibility by 24

Since $24 = 2^3 \cdot 3 = 8 \cdot 3$ , we need to check if the product is always divisible by $2^3$ (i.e., 8) and by 3, and since 8 and 3 are coprime, their product 24 divides the expression if both conditions hold.

#### Divisibility by 23=82^3 = 8

In any sequence of four consecutive integers, at least two are even (divisible by 2) because integers alternate between odd and even, and four terms span multiple pairs:

- $1, 2, 3, 4$ : even numbers are 2 (divisible by 2) and 4 (divisible by 4).
- $2, 3, 4, 5$ : even numbers are 2 (divisible by 2) and 4 (divisible by 4).
- $3, 4, 5, 6$ : even numbers are 4 (divisible by 4) and 6 (divisible by 2).

Among four consecutive integers, the even numbers occur at positions differing by 2, and one of them is always divisible by 4 (since multiples of 4 occur every fourth integer, and two even numbers ensure at least one aligns with this pattern). For example:

- In $1, 2, 3, 4$ , there are two factors of 2 from 2 ( $2^1$ ) and two from 4 ( $2^2$ ), totaling at least $2^3 = 8$ .
- In $2, 3, 4, 5$ , 2 provides $2^1$ and 4 provides $2^2$ , again at least $2^3$ .
- In $5, 6, 7, 8$ , 6 provides $2^1 \cdot 3$ and 8 provides $2^3$ , exceeding $2^3$ .

The exponent of 2 in the product is the sum of the exponents from each factor. With two even numbers, one divisible by at least $2^2 = 4$ and another by at least $2^1 = 2$ , the total is at least $2^{2+1} = 2^3 = 8$ . Thus, the product is always divisible by 8.

#### Divisibility by 3

Among four consecutive integers, at least one is divisible by 3, since the remainders modulo 3 cycle as $0, 1, 2$ , and four terms exceed this cycle length of 3:

- $1, 2, 3, 4$ : 3 is divisible by 3.
- $2, 3, 4, 5$ : 3 is divisible by 3.
- $3, 4, 5, 6$ : 3 and 6 are divisible by 3.

Thus, the product always includes at least one factor of 3.

#### Conclusion for 24

Since the product is always divisible by $2^3 = 8$ and by 3, and these factors are coprime, it is always divisible by $8 \cdot 3 = 24$ .

### Step 3: Check Divisibility by 48

Since $48 = 2^4 \cdot 3 = 24 \cdot 2$ , and we’ve established divisibility by 24, we need to determine if there’s always an additional factor of 2 (i.e., $2^4$ total). Compute the expression for specific $n$ :

- $n = 3$ : $1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 = 24$ . Then $24 / 24 = 1$ , divisible by 24; $24 / 48 = 0.5$ , not divisible by 48.
- $n = 4$ : $2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 = 120$ . Then $120 / 24 = 5$ , divisible by 24; $120 / 48 = 2.5$ , not divisible by 48.
- $n = 7$ : $5 \cdot 6 \cdot 7 \cdot 8 = 1680$ . Then $1680 / 24 = 70$ , divisible by 24; $1680 / 48 = 35$ , divisible by 48.

For $n = 3$ , the factors are $2^1$ (from 2) and $2^2$ (from 4), totaling $2^3 = 8$ , not $2^4 = 16$ . For $n = 7$ , factors include $2^1$ (from 6) and $2^3$ (from 8), totaling $2^4 = 16$ . The exponent of 2 depends on $n$ : it’s at least 3 but not always 4. Thus, the expression is not always divisible by 48.

### Step 4: Evaluate the Options

- **(A) Divisible by 6 but not always by 12**: Since it’s always divisible by 24, it’s always divisible by 12 (as $12 = 2^2 \cdot 3$ ), so “not always by 12” is false.
- **(B) Divisible by 12 but not always by 24**: It’s always divisible by 24, so “not always by 24” is false.
- **(C) Divisible by 24 but not always by 48**: It’s always divisible by 24, and not always by 48 (e.g., $n = 3$ ), so this is true.
- **(D) Divisible by 9**: For $n = 3$ , $24 / 9 \approx 2.67$ , not an integer; for $n = 4$ , $120 / 9 \approx 13.33$ , not an integer. It’s not always divisible by 9.

### Final Answer

The expression $(n^3 - n)(n - 2)$ for all integers $n \geq 3$ is divisible by 24 but not always divisible by 48. Thus, the correct option is (C).

Yeah could you give me a list of all the expansions like the one above n^2-1 that come handy and that I should remember

Sure! Here’s a list of algebraic expansions and factorizations that are handy to remember, similar to the one you mentioned, $n^2 - 1 = (n - 1)(n + 1)$ . These identities are useful for simplifying expressions, factoring polynomials, and solving equations quickly. I’ll focus on the most practical ones you’ll encounter often.

### 1\. Difference of Squares

This is the one you brought up, and it’s super common:

- $a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)$
- Example: $n^2 - 1 = (n - 1)(n + 1)$
- Use it whenever you see two perfect squares subtracted.

---

### 2\. Difference of Cubes

For expressions with cubes:

- $a^3 - b^3 = (a - b)(a^2 + ab + b^2)$
- Example: $x^3 - 8 = (x - 2)(x^2 + 2x + 4)$ (since $8 = 2^3$ )
- The second factor doesn’t factor further over the reals.

---

### 3\. Sum of Cubes

The counterpart to the difference of cubes:

- $a^3 + b^3 = (a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2)$
- Example: $x^3 + 27 = (x + 3)(x^2 - 3x + 9)$ (since $27 = 3^3$ )
- Again, the quadratic part stays intact over the reals.

---

### 4\. Perfect Square Trinomials

These show up when you square a binomial:

- $a^2 + 2ab + b^2 = (a + b)^2$
	- Example: $x^2 + 6x + 9 = (x + 3)^2$
- $a^2 - 2ab + b^2 = (a - b)^2$
	- Example: $x^2 - 10x + 25 = (x - 5)^2$
- Look for a middle term that’s twice the product of the square roots of the first and last terms.

---

### 5\. Binomial Expansions (Small Powers)

These are expansions of binomials raised to low powers:

- $(a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2$
	- Example: $(x + 4)^2 = x^2 + 8x + 16$
- $(a - b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2$
	- Example: $(x - 3)^2 = x^2 - 6x + 9$
- $(a + b)^3 = a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3$
	- Example: $(x + 2)^3 = x^3 + 6x^2 + 12x + 8$
- $(a - b)^3 = a^3 - 3a^2b + 3ab^2 - b^3$
	- Example: $(x - 1)^3 = x^3 - 3x^2 + 3x - 1$
- Memorize the pattern: the coefficients for $(a + b)^3$ are 1, 3, 3, 1, and signs flip appropriately for subtraction.

---

### 6\. Difference of Higher Powers

For higher powers, there’s a general form (especially useful when $n$ is odd or even):

- $a^n - b^n = (a - b)(a^{n-1} + a^{n-2}b + \cdots + ab^{n-2} + b^{n-1})$
	- Example: $x^4 - 16 = (x^2 - 4)(x^2 + 4) = (x - 2)(x + 2)(x^2 + 4)$ (since $16 = 2^4$ )
- When $n$ is odd, the sum works too:
	- $a^n + b^n = (a + b)(a^{n-1} - a^{n-2}b + \cdots - ab^{n-2} + b^{n-1})$
	- Example: $x^3 + 1 = (x + 1)(x^2 - x + 1)$

---

### 7\. Special Product

A quick one that ties back to the difference of squares:

- $(a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2$
- Example: $(x + 5)(x - 5) = x^2 - 25$
- It’s just the difference of squares in reverse.

---

### 8\. Square of a Trinomial

When you have three terms:

- $(a + b + c)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2ab + 2ac + 2bc$
- Example: $(x + y + 2)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + 4 + 2xy + 4x + 4y$
- Each term is squared, plus twice the product of every pair.

---

### Tips for Memorizing

- **Patterns:** Notice how the difference of squares ( $a^2 - b^2$ ) and cubes ( $a^3 - b^3$ ) always start with $(a - b)$ , while sums switch signs appropriately.
- **Practice:** Try factoring expressions like $x^2 - 49$ , $x^3 + 64$ , or expanding $(x + 3)^2$ to get comfortable.
- **Check:** Substitute small numbers (e.g., $a = 2, b = 1$ ) to verify each identity.

These should cover most common scenarios you’ll run into. Let me know if you want examples or more details on any of them!

any more?

Since you’ve asked “any more?” I assume you already have a solid list of algebraic identities and are looking for additional ones to expand your toolkit. Below, I’ve compiled a selection of less common but practical algebraic expansions and factorizations that complement the standard identities (like $a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)$ , $(a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2$ , etc.). These are useful for simplifying expressions, factoring polynomials, and solving equations efficiently.

### 1\. Difference of Fourth Powers

This extends the difference of squares to higher even powers:

- **Formula:** $a^4 - b^4 = (a^2 - b^2)(a^2 + b^2) = (a - b)(a + b)(a^2 + b^2)$
- **Example:** $x^4 - 16 = (x^2 - 4)(x^2 + 4) = (x - 2)(x + 2)(x^2 + 4)$
- **Use:** Great for factoring higher-degree polynomials.

### 2\. Factoring xn−1x^n - 1

This identity helps factor expressions involving powers minus 1:

- **Formula:** $x^n - 1 = (x - 1)(x^{n-1} + x^{n-2} + \cdots + x + 1)$
- **Specific Cases:**
	- For $n = 3$ : $x^3 - 1 = (x - 1)(x^2 + x + 1)$
	- For $n = 4$ : $x^4 - 1 = (x^2 - 1)(x^2 + 1) = (x - 1)(x + 1)(x^2 + 1)$
- **Example:** $x^3 - 1 = (x - 1)(x^2 + x + 1)$ , and check: if $x = 2$ , $8 - 1 = 7$ and $(2 - 1)(4 + 2 + 1) = 1 \cdot 7 = 7$ .
- **Use:** Useful in polynomial factoring and finding roots.

---

### 3\. Completing the Square

A technique to rewrite quadratics in a vertex form:

- **Formula:** $ax^2 + bx + c = a\left(x + \frac{b}{2a}\right)^2 + \left(c - \frac{b^2}{4a}\right)$
- **Example:** $x^2 + 6x + 5 = (x + 3)^2 - 9 + 5 = (x + 3)^2 - 4$
- **Use:** Essential for solving quadratic equations, finding parabola vertices, or simplifying expressions.

---

### 4\. Factoring Expressions with Multiple Variables

Combines perfect squares and differences:

- **Formula:** $a^2 + 2ab + b^2 - c^2 = (a + b)^2 - c^2 = (a + b - c)(a + b + c)$
- **Example:** $x^2 + 6x + 9 - y^2 = (x + 3)^2 - y^2 = (x + 3 - y)(x + 3 + y)$
- **Use:** Simplifies expressions with multiple terms.

---

### 5\. Sum of Three Cubes

A less common but powerful identity:

- **Formula:** $a^3 + b^3 + c^3 - 3abc = (a + b + c)(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - ab - ac - bc)$
- **Example:** $x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - xz - yz)$
- **Verification:** If $x = 1, y = 1, z = 1$ , then $1 + 1 + 1 - 3 = 0$ , and $(1 + 1 + 1)(1 + 1 + 1 - 1 - 1 - 1) = 3 \cdot 0 = 0$ .
- **Use:** Handy for factoring complex cubic expressions.

---

### 6\. Sum of Squares Rearrangement

While $a^2 + b^2$ doesn’t factor over the reals, it can be rewritten:

- **Formula:** $a^2 + b^2 = (a + b)^2 - 2ab$
- **Example:** $x^2 + 9 = (x + 3)^2 - 6x$
- **Use:** Useful for rewriting expressions, though not a factorization.

---

### 7\. Binomial Expansion for Higher Powers

For higher powers beyond $n = 2$ or $3$ :

- **Formula:** $(a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4$ (coefficients from Pascal’s triangle: 1, 4, 6, 4, 1)
- **General Form:** $(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k$
- **Example:** $(x + 2)^4 = x^4 + 8x^3 + 24x^2 + 32x + 16$
- **Use:** Expands expressions with larger exponents efficiently.

---

### Tips for Memorizing and Using These Identities

- **Recognize Patterns:** Many build on simpler identities (e.g., $a^4 - b^4$ extends $a^2 - b^2$ ).
- **Practice:** Try factoring $x^4 - 1$ or expanding $(x + y + z)^2$ to get comfortable.
- **Verify:** Test with numbers, e.g., for $a^4 - b^4$ , let $a = 2, b = 1$ : $16 - 1 = 15$ , and $(4 - 1)(4 + 1) = 3 \cdot 5 = 15$ .

These identities should give you more tools for algebra, calculus, and problem-solving. If you’d like examples or further clarification on any of them, just let me know! https://grok.com/chat/062c2819-be43-422a-bf3f-2c6fe7416e33
