Most people today would say they do not follow a religion. They may even pride themselves on being rational, evidence-based, or fact-driven. But the truth is, many of them follow a belief system; they just do not call it that. The belief system is called scientism, and it has quietly become the dominant worldview of the modern age.

To be clear, this is not a critique of science itself. Science is a method, and a brilliant one, for understanding the natural world. It is based on observation, testing, and refinement, and it has given us medicine, technology, and enormous insight into how nature works. But scientism is not science. Scientism is the belief that science is not only the best way to understand reality, but the only legitimate way. It assumes that everything real can ultimately be measured, tested, quantified, and explained through empirical analysis. Anything outside of that, whether it be subjective experience, personal meaning, spirituality, or inner transformation, is seen as either irrelevant or false.

This belief is so deeply embedded in modern society that most people do not even notice it. It exists in our schools, where children are taught that personal experience is anecdotal and that only measurable outcomes matter. It appears in our media, where phrases like “follow the science” are used as if they are sacred doctrine. It can be seen in our politics, where unelected technocrats increasingly make decisions based on models and simulations, often without seriously considering the moral, psychological, or cultural consequences.

Scientism has become a kind of secular religion. It has its own high priests in the form of experts and credentialed authorities. It has its sacred texts, such as peer-reviewed journals and official guidelines. It has rituals like public health protocols and standardized testing. It even has heresies. Questioning official narratives, trusting intuition, or speaking from lived experience is often met with ridicule or censorship. It is a belief system that claims to be beyond belief systems, which is precisely what makes it so powerful and so difficult to question.

But here is where the real damage begins. When scientism dominates, the inner world of the human being is dismissed.

Love becomes a neurochemical event. Grief is seen as a stress response. A mystical experience is merely described as a serotonin surge. Our deepest joys and most profound losses are treated as chemical fluctuations in a brain, not as meaningful events in a soul. Our lived experiences, the kind that shape who we are, are reduced to statistical anomalies or subjective noise. If something cannot be repeated in a laboratory, it does not count.

This way of thinking gradually seeps into everyday life. People begin to distrust their own perceptions. They may feel something deeply but are told it is just in their head. They may sense something is wrong in the world but are told they must defer to experts. They may witness something with their own eyes yet are told that the data says otherwise. In this way, scientism fosters a subtle but powerful form of alienation, not from nature or society, but from the self.

A person who no longer trusts their inner compass is easier to influence. Once your experience, intuition, and insight are considered invalid unless externally verified, you become dependent on outside authorities to tell you what is real. This is not science. This is control.

And this is not hypothetical. We have seen it unfold in recent history. During the COVID-19 pandemic, for example, many people who spoke from lived experience, including doctors who disagreed with institutional protocols and individuals who felt harmed by standard treatments, were ignored or silenced. Questioning dominant narratives was enough to be labeled anti-science, even when the questions were based on evidence or genuine concern. The irony is that science itself thrives on questioning, on doubt, on the refinement of understanding through open discourse. Yet under scientism, disagreement is often treated as heresy.

In mental health, a similar pattern is visible. There is a growing tendency to reduce depression, anxiety, and trauma to chemical imbalances, even though that theory is scientifically contested. Meanwhile, approaches that are harder to measure, such as meditation, storytelling, spiritual practice, or community support, are often dismissed or marginalized. Not because they do not help, but because they do not fit easily into the empirical framework.

The deeper tragedy of scientism is that it flattens the human experience. It encourages people to see themselves as machines, as collections of biological parts following deterministic laws. It leaves no room for mystery, for beauty that cannot be dissected, or for wonder that does not come with a citation. The soul becomes an outdated metaphor. Awe becomes an evolutionary side effect.

But science itself never asked for this. The greatest scientists have always acknowledged the limits of their work. Albert Einstein once said that the most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious. He understood that science is a powerful tool, but not an all-encompassing one. Carl Jung warned of the spiritual hollowness that can emerge in a society ruled only by rationality. Aldous Huxley envisioned a future where scientific progress enabled authoritarian control. C.S. Lewis cautioned that if we reduce humans to machines, we will soon justify treating them as such.

What we are witnessing is not the triumph of reason. It is the slow erosion of the human spirit, disguised as intellectual progress. It is the replacement of mystery with mechanism, of wisdom with data, and of truth with consensus.

But we are not machines. We are not accidents. We are not merely clusters of neurons responding to stimuli. We are conscious, creative, meaning-making beings. We experience love, loss, purpose, fear, joy, transcendence. And these experiences are not illusions. They are the core of what makes life worth living.

The moment we accept a worldview that dismisses the subjective, we begin to lose our humanity. The sacred cannot be isolated in a petri dish or revealed through instrumentation. The soul does not appear on a brain scan. But that does not mean these things are not real.

If you feel that something is off in the modern world, if you feel spiritually starved, emotionally disconnected, or existentially unanchored, you are not imagining things. You are waking up to the limits of a worldview that pretends to be complete. You are remembering that reality is deeper than data, that truth is not always testable, and that your experience has value, even if no one else can measure it.

Ask questions. Trust your intuition. Protect your inner life. Science is a tool, not a religion. The moment we forget that, we risk losing everything that makes us human.

Most of the physical world is too big, too small, too far away, too hot, or too dangerous to be subject to scientific scrutiny, nevertheless, hack theories are proposed and accepted by consensus. The obsession to attempt to explain what cannot be legitimately and scientifically explained is founded in pride and arrogance.

> I always saw these kind of rationalists as extremely close minded. like to me there isn’t much difference between religious extermists and rational ones, both of these often think in a similar way which is mostly based on what they want to believe rather than having any analytical/critical observations of the reality that wouldn’t be tainted by some perception biases which are mainly inflicted by the hivemind of the society and some other environmental factors like propaganda etc.
> 
> I remember ever telling some rationalist about experiencing some telepathic ability , like it’s not even what most people think it is, like about hearing other people thoughts in our minds, but it’s more like having a random thought/intuition that turns out to be shared. And it happened enough times for me to tell it’s not just coincidence , especially that the random thought was random enough and not even related with the discussed topic with the person I experienced this phenomenon with. And their reaction was giving me some unrelated Wikipedia article about some probablitilty stuff which was supposed to explain this phenomenon in scientific way , but I didn’t even see any correlation with it at all🤦🏻‍♂️ .
> 
> I think the main purpose of this brainwashing, is about creating obedient puppets that wouldn’t question anything and blindly believe in science/system, because there’s a risk they could accidentally find out that the modern society is fundamentally corrupted and built upon lies that became broadly accepted as something natural, because people are taught to believe there are some experts for every aspect of their lives that can do the thinking part for them and that they also work in their best interest.
> 
> also, there is a tendency of the system to label any abnormalities as disabilities and forcing people to conform to the system rather than the other way around. If you can’t work like normal person with regular work/rest time then you’re disabled and need to get on some meds, it doesn’t matter that you probably have higher abilities for non-linear thinking or some other perks, if you’re not like one of the NPC that they want to manufacture you will be labeled as flawed. This also reminds me when I first read about autism many years ago and I immadiately rejected the possibility of being on the spectrum because of their given science. like some years ago you could read for example that autistic people lack empathy, there wasn’t any mention of the fact that their empathetic ability work in a different way than regular person. they were just told to be lacking empathy, and also some other nonsense of this sort that seemed to be based more on assumptions and some biases rather than truly understanding neurodivergent minds.

> The problem is that rational enquiry makes it blatantly obvious that the organised religions are a sham, yet those religions have not yielded and nobody has proposed an alternative that is compatible with rationality. Those do exist, such as Deism. I agree that the world needs spiritual guidance but a new belief system that doesn't run completely contrary to rationality is required. The traditional religions will slowly but surely continue to die off for as long as they contradict basic reasoning.
