When banks have extra money, what do they do with it? SDF is a mechanism that helps manage such extra liquidity in the economy. Standing Deposit Facility (SDF) is a monetary policy tool introduced by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on April 8, 2022,. It aims to absorb excess liquidity from the banking system. SDF allows banks to temporarily deposit their surplus funds with the RBI without any collateral and earn an interest rate on it. However, why does our economy need a facility like SDF? 

The RBI pays them an interest rate for using this facility, which is called the SDF rate. 

In simple terms, SDF is like a secured deposit facility for banks to keep their extra money, and the SDF rate is the interest they earn for doing so.

The RBI introduced SDF as a way to manage liquidity in the economy, especially in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in a huge influx of funds into the banking system. 

The excess liquidity in the system poses a challenge for the RBI. It can create inflationary pressures and cause hindrance in the implementation of monetary policy.

SDF RBI acts as the support tool to the existing monetary policy tools like marginal standing facility, cash reserve ratio, reverse repos, and open market transactions. 

- **LAF corridor:** It is an important indicator of the monetary policy of the RBI. It influences the short-term interest rates in the money market.

### SDF and MSF: Standing Deposit Facility  vs Marginal Standing Facility 

The Standing Deposit Facility (SDF) and the Marginal Standing Facility (MSF) are both tools used by the Reserve Bank of India for liquidity management. 

Standing Deposit Facility (SDF) aims to absorb excess liquidity from banks. It doesn’t require a collateral.

Marginal Standing Facility (MSF) aims to provide emergency liquidity to banks. However, it does require government securities as collateral.

SDF works as an overnight facility, which means that banks can deposit their excess funds with the RBI for one day and get them back the next day. 

Scheduled commercial banks, regional rural banks, small finance banks, payments banks, local area banks, urban cooperative banks, district central cooperative banks and even the state cooperative banks. 

SDF provides banks with flexibility.  It also lessens dependence on reverse repo, which requires collateral. 

**• Monetary Policy Effectiveness**

SDF enhances the usefulness of the RBI’s monetary policy. This helps the RBI to maintain price stability and support economic growth.

**• Policy Rate Transmissions:** 

SDF improves the transmission of the RBI’s policy rates to the market rates by widening the LAF corridor. This reduces the cost of borrowing for the banks and their customers and promotes credit demand and investment.

**• Overall Liquidity Management**

SDF tool provides an attractive and risk-free option for the banks to park their excess funds. This improves the profitability and liquidity position of the banks.

**•  Market Stability**

SDF reduces the volatility and uncertainty in the money market. This enhances the efficiency and stability of the financial system and fosters financial inclusion.
