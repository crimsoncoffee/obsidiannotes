Let’s solve this probability problem step by step. We have an urn containing 4 white balls, 6 red balls, and 5 black balls, making a total of 15 balls. From this urn, 5 balls are randomly selected without replacement. We’re given that $Y = 2$  , where $Y$  is the number of black balls selected, meaning exactly 2 of the 5 selected balls are black. Our task is to find the probability that $X = 2$  , where $X$  is the number of white balls selected, under this condition. This is a conditional probability, $P(X = 2 | Y = 2)$  .

### Step 1: Understand the Problem

Since 5 balls are selected and 2 of them are black (because $Y = 2$  ), the remaining 3 balls must be a combination of white and red balls:

- Total balls selected = 5
- Black balls ( $Y$  ) = 2
- Remaining balls = $5 - 2 = 3$

These 3 remaining balls are drawn from the non-black balls in the urn. The urn has:

- White balls = 4
- Red balls = 6
- Black balls = 5
- Total balls = 15

The non-black balls are the white and red balls:

- Total non-black balls = $4 + 6 = 10$

Among these 3 remaining balls, we want exactly 2 to be white ( $X = 2$  ), which means the other 1 must be red (since only white and red balls are possible among the non-black balls):

- White balls = 2
- Red balls = $3 - 2 = 1$

### Step 2: Set Up the Conditional Probability

We need $P(X = 2 | Y = 2)$  , the probability that 2 of the 5 selected balls are white, given that 2 are black. Since $Y = 2$  fixes the number of black balls at 2, the remaining 3 balls are selected from the 10 non-black balls (4 white and 6 red). This scenario resembles a hypergeometric distribution, where we’re selecting 3 balls from a population of 10, with 4 “successes” (white balls) and 6 “failures” (red balls), and we want exactly 2 successes.

### Step 3: Use the Hypergeometric Distribution

For a hypergeometric distribution with:

- Population size $N = 10$  (total non-black balls),
- Number of successes $K = 4$  (white balls),
- Sample size $n = 3$  (remaining balls),
- Number of successes in the sample $x = 2$  (white balls),

the probability is:

$P(X = 2 | Y = 2) = \frac{\binom{K}{x} \cdot \binom{N - K}{n - x}}{\binom{N}{n}}$

Substitute the values:

- $\binom{K}{x} = \binom{4}{2}$  (ways to choose 2 white balls from 4),
- $\binom{N - K}{n - x} = \binom{10 - 4}{3 - 2} = \binom{6}{1}$  (ways to choose 1 red ball from 6),
- $\binom{N}{n} = \binom{10}{3}$  (ways to choose 3 balls from 10).

Calculate each combination:

- $\binom{4}{2} = \frac{4 \cdot 3}{2 \cdot 1} = 6$  ,
- $\binom{6}{1} = 6$  ,
- $\binom{10}{3} = \frac{10 \cdot 9 \cdot 8}{3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1} = \frac{720}{6} = 120$  .

Now compute the probability: $P(X = 2 | Y = 2) = \frac{\binom{4}{2} \cdot \binom{6}{1}}{\binom{10}{3}} = \frac{6 \cdot 6}{120} = \frac{36}{120}$

Simplify the fraction: $\frac{36}{120} = \frac{36 \div 12}{120 \div 12} = \frac{3}{10}$

So, $P(X = 2 | Y = 2) = \frac{3}{10}$  .

### Step 4: Verify with an Alternative Approach

To ensure correctness, let’s compute it using the definition of conditional probability:

$P(X = 2 | Y = 2) = \frac{P(X = 2, Y = 2)}{P(Y = 2)}$

This uses the multivariate hypergeometric distribution for the joint and marginal probabilities.

#### Compute P(X=2,Y=2) P(X = 2, Y = 2)

- $X = 2$  (2 white balls),
- $Y = 2$  (2 black balls),
- Total balls selected = 5,
- Red balls = $5 - 2 - 2 = 1$  .

The multivariate hypergeometric probability is: $P(X = 2, Y = 2) = \frac{\binom{4}{2} \cdot \binom{5}{2} \cdot \binom{6}{1}}{\binom{15}{5}}$

- $\binom{4}{2} = 6$  ,
- $\binom{5}{2} = \frac{5 \cdot 4}{2 \cdot 1} = 10$  ,
- $\binom{6}{1} = 6$  ,
- $\binom{15}{5} = \frac{15 \cdot 14 \cdot 13 \cdot 12 \cdot 11}{5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1} = 3003$  .

$P(X = 2, Y = 2) = \frac{6 \cdot 10 \cdot 6}{3003} = \frac{360}{3003}$  Simplify: $360 \div 3 = 120$  , $3003 \div 3 = 1001$  , $\frac{360}{3003} = \frac{120}{1001}$

#### Compute P(Y=2) P(Y = 2)

- $Y = 2$  (2 black balls),
- Total draws = 5,
- Remaining balls = $5 - 2 = 3$  from 10 non-black balls.

$P(Y = 2) = \frac{\binom{5}{2} \cdot \binom{15 - 5}{5 - 2}}{\binom{15}{5}} = \frac{\binom{5}{2} \cdot \binom{10}{3}}{\binom{15}{5}}$

- $\binom{5}{2} = 10$  ,
- $\binom{10}{3} = 120$  ,
- $\binom{15}{5} = 3003$  .

$P(Y = 2) = \frac{10 \cdot 120}{3003} = \frac{1200}{3003}$  Simplify: $1200 \div 3 = 400$  , $3003 \div 3 = 1001$  , $\frac{1200}{3003} = \frac{400}{1001}$

#### Conditional Probability

$P(X = 2 | Y = 2) = \frac{P(X = 2, Y = 2)}{P(Y = 2)} = \frac{\frac{120}{1001}}{\frac{400}{1001}} = \frac{120}{400} = \frac{3}{10}$

Both methods agree: $P(X = 2 | Y = 2) = \frac{3}{10}$  .

### Step 5: Match with Options

The options are:

- (A) $\frac{3}{10}$  ,
- (B) $\frac{4}{10}$  ,
- (C) $\frac{3}{15}$  ,
- (D) $\frac{4}{15}$  .

Our result, $\frac{3}{10}$  , matches option (A).

### Final Answer

The probability that $X = 2$  given $Y = 2$  is $\frac{3}{10}$  , so the correct answer is option (A).

I was directly calculating the probabilites such as 1/3, multiplied by 1/3 then. I want to know how could have arrived at that way of solving without knowing about Hypergeometric

---

Let’s dive into solving this problem from scratch, focusing on how you might have been calculating probabilities like $\frac{1}{3} \times \frac{1}{3}$  , and explore a natural way to arrive at the correct solution without relying on advanced formulas like the hypergeometric distribution. We’ll use basic probability ideas—thinking step-by-step about picking balls from an urn—and keep it intuitive.

### Setting Up the Problem

Imagine an urn with:

- 4 white balls,
- 6 red balls,
- 5 black balls,
- Total = 15 balls.

You’re picking 5 balls without replacement (meaning once a ball is chosen, it’s out of the urn). The problem specifies that exactly 2 of these 5 balls are black, and you want to find the probability that exactly 2 of them are white. Let’s call:

- $X$  the number of white balls,
- $Y$  the number of black balls.

So, we need the probability $P(X = 2 \text{ given } Y = 2)$  .

### Breaking It Down

Since exactly 2 of the 5 balls are black ( $Y = 2$  ), that leaves 3 balls to be chosen from the remaining types—white and red. In the urn, there are:

- 4 white balls,
- 6 red balls,
- Total non-black balls = 4 + 6 = 10.

These 3 remaining balls determine whether we get exactly 2 white balls ( $X = 2$  ). If we have 2 white balls and 2 black balls in our 5, the fifth ball must be red (since 2 + 2 + 1 = 5), and we’ll confirm that works with the numbers available.

### A Simple Approach: Picking the Non-Black Balls

Let’s focus on those 3 non-black balls. We’re picking 3 balls from the 10 non-black ones (4 white, 6 red), and we want exactly 2 to be white (leaving 1 red). This feels like a probability puzzle we can solve by thinking about the chances of picking white and red balls in different ways.

#### Sequential Picking (Order Matters for a Moment)

Suppose we pick these 3 balls one by one, and we want to figure out the probability of getting exactly 2 white and 1 red. Let’s try imagining the order of picks, since your approach with fractions like $\frac{1}{3}$  suggests you were thinking about probabilities per pick.

- **Case 1: White, White, Red (WWR)**
	- First pick (white): 4 white out of 10 balls = $\frac{4}{10} = \frac{2}{5}$  .
	- Second pick (white): 3 white left, 9 balls left = $\frac{3}{9} = \frac{1}{3}$  .
	- Third pick (red): 6 red, 8 balls left = $\frac{6}{8} = \frac{3}{4}$  .
	- Probability = $\frac{4}{10} \times \frac{3}{9} \times \frac{6}{8}$  .  
		Compute: $\frac{4 \times 3 \times 6}{10 \times 9 \times 8} = \frac{72}{720} = \frac{1}{10}$  .
- **Case 2: White, Red, White (WRW)**
	- First pick (white): $\frac{4}{10}$  .
	- Second pick (red): 6 red, 9 left = $\frac{6}{9} = \frac{2}{3}$  .
	- Third pick (white): 3 white, 8 left = $\frac{3}{8}$  .
	- Probability = $\frac{4}{10} \times \frac{6}{9} \times \frac{3}{8} = \frac{4 \times 6 \times 3}{10 \times 9 \times 8} = \frac{72}{720} = \frac{1}{10}$  .
- **Case 3: Red, White, White (RWW)**
	- First pick (red): $\frac{6}{10} = \frac{3}{5}$  .
	- Second pick (white): 4 white, 9 left = $\frac{4}{9}$  .
	- Third pick (white): 3 white, 8 left = $\frac{3}{8}$  .
	- Probability = $\frac{6}{10} \times \frac{4}{9} \times \frac{3}{8} = \frac{6 \times 4 \times 3}{10 \times 9 \times 8} = \frac{72}{720} = \frac{1}{10}$  .

Each sequence—WWR, WRW, RWW—gives $\frac{1}{10}$  . These are the only ways to arrange 2 white and 1 red in 3 picks (since we need exactly 2 white). There are 3 possible orders (choose 2 out of 3 positions for the white balls), so:

- Total probability = $3 \times \frac{1}{10} = \frac{3}{10}$  .

This makes sense! Each way of ordering 2 white and 1 red has the same probability, and there are 3 ways to do it.

#### Connecting to Your Approach

You mentioned calculating $\frac{1}{3} \times \frac{1}{3}$  . Notice that in our sequences, fractions like $\frac{1}{3}$  pop up (e.g., $\frac{3}{9} = \frac{1}{3}$  ). You might have been estimating probabilities per pick and multiplying them, perhaps assuming equal chances or simplifying the fractions. Let’s explore that intuition. If you thought each pick had a $\frac{1}{3}$  chance of being white (maybe approximating the proportions), multiplying them directly wouldn’t account for changing totals or the need for 1 red. Our sequential method adjusts for that by tracking the remaining balls each time.

### A Counting Approach (No Fancy Formulas)

Let’s try another angle to confirm, avoiding sequences. Think about the 3 balls as a group:

- **Total ways to pick 3 from 10**: How many different sets of 3 can we make from 10 balls? We could list them, but let’s use a shortcut with counting (still basic):
	- Pick 3 balls, order doesn’t matter eventually, but for probability, we’ll get there.
- **Favorable ways**: We want 2 white (from 4) and 1 red (from 6).
	- Ways to pick 2 white from 4: $4 \times 3 / 2 = 6$  (first white has 4 choices, second has 3, divide by 2 since order doesn’t matter in the set).
	- Ways to pick 1 red from 6: 6.
	- Favorable sets = $6 \times 6 = 36$  .
- **Total sets**: Pick any 3 from 10: $10 \times 9 \times 8 / (3 \times 2 \times 1) = 120$  (first has 10 choices, second 9, third 8, divide by 3! since order doesn’t matter).
- Probability = $\frac{36}{120} = \frac{3}{10}$  .

This matches our sequential method! We didn’t need a special formula—just counted possibilities.

### Why It Works Without Advanced Math

The key insight is that once 2 balls are fixed as black, we’re really just picking 3 from the 10 non-black balls. The probability of getting 2 white among those 3 depends only on the white and red balls left. Whether we:

- Calculate it by picking balls one by one and summing the ways (like WWR, WRW, RWW),
- Or count all possible groups and the favorable ones, we land on $\frac{3}{10}$  .

Your instinct to multiply probabilities like $\frac{1}{3}$  was a start toward this sequential idea. To get the right answer, adjust each pick for the remaining balls (since it’s without replacement) and count all the ways to arrange your target (2 white, 1 red). That’s how you can build up to $\frac{3}{10}$  naturally, without knowing any advanced distributions.

So, the probability that exactly 2 of the 5 balls are white, given that 2 are black, is $\frac{3}{10}$  .

but what about the remaining 3 black balls

---

I understand your concern about the remaining 3 black balls, and I’ll explain why they don’t affect the probability we’re calculating in this problem. Let’s break it down clearly and completely.

### Problem Setup

We have an urn containing:

- 4 white balls
- 6 red balls
- 5 black balls

That’s a total of 15 balls. We select 5 balls without replacement, and we’re given that exactly 2 of them are black. The question is about the probability that exactly 2 of the selected balls are white, given this condition. Your query specifically asks about the remaining 3 black balls, so let’s address that directly.

### What the Condition Means

The condition tells us that out of the 5 balls we’ve selected, exactly 2 are black. Since 5 balls are selected in total:

- **Black balls selected**: 2
- **Remaining balls selected**: 5 - 2 = 3

These 3 remaining balls must come from the non-black balls in the urn, which are the white and red balls. There are:

- 4 white + 6 red = 10 non-black balls

So, those 3 balls are chosen from these 10 non-black balls (4 white and 6 red). We need to find the probability that, among these 3, exactly 2 are white.

### Where Are the Remaining 3 Black Balls?

The urn originally has 5 black balls, and we’ve selected exactly 2 of them in our group of 5 balls. This leaves:

- 5 black balls - 2 selected = **3 black balls remaining in the urn**

These 3 black balls are the ones that were *not* selected. Your question seems to be about whether these remaining black balls impact the probability calculation. The key point is that they don’t, and here’s why.

### Why the Remaining Black Balls Don’t Affect the Answer

Since we’re selecting 5 balls without replacement and the condition specifies that exactly 2 of them are black, our focus shifts to the composition of the other 3 balls in the selection. The fact that 3 black balls remain in the urn is simply a consequence of the selection process—they’re the black balls we didn’t pick. The probability we’re calculating is *conditional* on already having exactly 2 black balls in our selection of 5. This means:

- The selection of the 2 black balls is fixed by the condition.
- The remaining 3 balls in our selection are determined solely by how we choose from the 10 non-black balls (4 white and 6 red).

The black balls left in the urn (those 3) are outside our selection of 5 balls, so they don’t influence the makeup of the 3 non-black balls we’ve chosen.

### Calculating the Probability

Now, let’s compute the probability that exactly 2 of the 5 selected balls are white, given that 2 are black. Since 2 are black, the other 3 must be some combination of white and red, and we want exactly 2 of those 3 to be white (leaving 1 red).

- **Total ways to choose 3 balls from 10 non-black balls**:
	$$
	\binom{10}{3} = \frac{10 \times 9 \times 8}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = 120
	$$
- **Favorable ways to choose 2 white and 1 red**:
	- Ways to choose 2 white from 4 white:
		$$
		\binom{4}{2} = \frac{4 \times 3}{2 \times 1} = 6
		$$
	- Ways to choose 1 red from 6 red:
		$$
		\binom{6}{1} = 6
		$$
	- Total favorable ways:
		$$
		\binom{4}{2} \times \binom{6}{1} = 6 \times 6 = 36
		$$
- **Probability**:
	$$
	\text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of favorable ways}}{\text{Total ways}} = \frac{36}{120} = \frac{3}{10}
	$$

This tells us that the probability of having exactly 2 white balls in the selection, given that 2 are black, is $\frac{3}{10}$ .

### Connecting Back to the Remaining Black Balls

The remaining 3 black balls are the ones left in the urn after we’ve made our selection of 5 balls (2 black + 3 non-black). They don’t affect this calculation because:

- The condition has already locked in the number of black balls in our selection (2).
- The probability question is about the distribution of white and red balls among the 3 non-black balls selected, which depends only on the pool of 10 non-black balls.

Think of it like this: once we’ve picked our 5 balls and know that 2 are black, the “fate” of the black balls is settled—2 are in our hand, and 3 are left behind. The question then becomes a matter of how the white and red balls were split in that selection, and the leftover black balls in the urn don’t change that split.

### Final Answer

So, to address your query directly: the remaining 3 black balls are simply the black balls that weren’t selected, and they don’t impact the probability we’re calculating. The probability that exactly 2 of the 5 selected balls are white, given that exactly 2 are black, is $\frac{3}{10}$ , based on choosing 2 white and 1 red from the 10 non-black balls for the remaining 3 spots in the selection.

---

but the black balls are still in the urn right than how does it not matter

---

I understand your confusion—since the black balls are still in the urn, it might seem like they should affect the probability. Let me explain why they don’t matter in this specific situation, step by step, so it’s clear and intuitive.

### The Setup

Imagine an urn with:

- 4 white balls
- 6 red balls
- 5 black balls

That’s a total of 15 balls. Now, 5 balls are drawn from this urn without replacement (meaning once a ball is picked, it’s not put back). We’re told that **exactly 2 of these 5 selected balls are black**, and we need to find the probability that **exactly 2 of the 5 selected balls are white**, given this condition.

### Breaking Down the Selection

Since exactly 2 of the 5 selected balls are black, that leaves:

- **5 total selected balls** – **2 black balls** = **3 non-black balls**.

These 3 non-black balls must be some combination of white and red balls because the urn only contains white, red, and black balls, and we’ve already accounted for the 2 black ones in the selection.

### Where Do These 3 Non-Black Balls Come From?

In the urn, before any balls are drawn, there are:

- 4 white balls + 6 red balls = **10 non-black balls**.

The 3 non-black balls in our selection were chosen from these 10 non-black balls. The key here is that the condition—“exactly 2 of the 5 selected balls are black”—has already happened. We’re not calculating the probability of picking the black balls; we’re focusing on the balls that were picked alongside them, which are from the white and red balls only.

### Why Don’t the Remaining Black Balls Matter?

You’re right that there are black balls still in the urn—specifically, since there were 5 black balls originally and 2 were selected, **3 black balls remain in the urn**. But here’s why they don’t affect the probability we’re calculating:

- **The selection is already made**: When we talk about the 5 balls that were picked, we know 2 are black. The question is about the other 3 balls in that selection, and those 3 can only be white or red because they’re the non-black balls that were chosen.
- **The remaining black balls are left behind**: Those 3 black balls still in the urn weren’t selected. They’re just sitting there, and they don’t change the fact that our selection already has exactly 2 black balls. The probability we want is about how the 3 non-black balls in our hand split between white and red, not about what’s left in the urn.
- **Focus on the non-black balls**: Since the 2 black balls are fixed by the condition, we’re really asking: “Out of the 10 non-black balls (4 white + 6 red), what’s the chance that the 3 that got picked include exactly 2 white ones?”

### A Simple Analogy

Think of it like picking a team of 5 people from a group where some wear black shirts, some white shirts, and some red shirts. You’re told that your team of 5 has exactly 2 people in black shirts. Now, you’re asked: “What’s the probability that exactly 2 of your team members are wearing white shirts?”

- The people in black shirts left in the group don’t join your team—they’re irrelevant to what’s already on your team.
- You’re only looking at the 3 other team members (who aren’t wearing black shirts) and figuring out how many wear white vs. red.

### The Calculation

Let’s compute it:

- **Total non-black balls**: 4 white + 6 red = 10.
- **We need 3 non-black balls**, with exactly 2 being white (and thus 1 red, since 2 white + 1 red = 3).
- Ways to choose 2 white balls from 4: $\binom{4}{2} = 6$
- Ways to choose 1 red ball from 6: $\binom{6}{1} = 6$
- Total ways to choose 3 balls from 10 non-black balls: $\binom{10}{3} = 120$

So, the probability is:

$$
\frac{\text{Ways to get 2 white and 1 red}}{\text{Total ways to pick 3 non-black}} = \frac{6 \times 6}{120} = \frac{36}{120} = \frac{3}{10}
$$

### Final Clarification

The black balls left in the urn don’t appear in this calculation because we’re not picking any more balls—we’re analyzing the 5 that were already picked. The condition locks in the 2 black balls in our selection, so the remaining 3 balls come from the 10 non-black balls only. The 3 black balls still in the urn are just spectators—they don’t influence how the white and red balls were distributed in our selection.

So, the probability that exactly 2 of the 5 selected balls are white, given that exactly 2 are black, is **3/10**. I hope that clears up why the black balls in the urn don’t matter here!
