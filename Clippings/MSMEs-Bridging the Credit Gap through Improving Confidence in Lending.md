A very good evening to you all. 1. I am delighted to speak to you today on a topic that has always been close to my heart—the critical role of MSMEs and the importance of building confidence in lending to this vital sector. Over the years, I have had the opportunity to work closely with MSME units, witnessing both their potential and their struggles. In the early days of my career, as a young officer posted in the bustling Peenya Industrial Area, I saw firsthand the energy and resilience that defined MSMEs, as well as the unique challenges they faced. Later, mid-career, my experience deepened while working in the Mid Corporates Group of SBI, where I further understood how access to timely and adequate credit could transform these businesses. These experiences have made me keenly aware of the importance of bridging the credit"

	  critical role of MSMEs and the importance of building confidence in lending to this vital sector
	  
	  Peenya Industrial Area,
	  
	  Mid Corporates Group of SBI
	  
	  how access to timely and adequate credit could transform these businesses
	  
	  but also a firm commitment to fostering confidence among lenders and borrowers alike
	  
	  These enterprises serve as essential support units for larger industries and contribute significantly to the secondary and tertiary sectors
	  
	  approximatel**y 6.3 crore units**
	  
	  **MSMEs contribute nearly a third of India’s nominal GDP** and account for over **40 per cent of the country’s exports**
	  
	  generating over 22 crore jobs[<sup>3</sup>](https://website.rbi.org.in/en/web/rbi/-/speeches-interview/#_ftn3)
	  
	  they find it difficult to secure timely and adequate formal credit.
	  
	  information asymmetry on their financials and business viability,
	  
	  and also on account of limited formalization even today within the MSME sector
	  
	  MSMEs lack comprehensive financial records or credit scores, and in some cases, they may not have sufficient collateral to support the scale of financing they require.
	  
	  credit needs of these units and the available supply—creating what is known as the credit gap.
	  
	  Five years ago, the **Report of the Expert Committee on MSME (Chair: U.K. Sinha)** constituted by RBI estimated this credit gap to be between ₹20 and ₹25 lakh crore,
	  
	  **RBI Initiatives**
	  
	  consistently prioritised the inclusion of MSMEs in the **formal financial system** through a range of targeted measures.
	  **Priority Sector Lending (PSL) guidelines**, *mandating a sub-target of 7.5 per cent of banks’ adjusted net bank credit for micro enterprises*,
	  
	  RBI has also promoted **collateral-free lending by requiring banks not to insist on collateral for loans up to ₹10 lakh for micro and small enterprises (MSEs**) and encouraging financial institutions to **lend under the CGTMSE**
	  carries zero risk weight for the guaranteed portion of loans
	  
	  To address the issue of delayed payment to MSMEs,
	  **Trade Receivables Discounting System (TReDS)** facilitates MSMEs' trade receivable financing through electronic platforms
	  
	  **Account Aggregator (AA) framework and inclusion of GSTN in the AA ecosystem streamline financial data access for MSME lendin**g
	  
	  Unified Lending Interface (ULI), launched as a pilot program in August 2023, allows MSMEs to access tailored, frictionless credit using digital data.
	  
	  implemented a revival and rehabilitation framework for MSME loans up to ₹25 crore,
	  
	  on the tap structured mechanism for stress resolution.
	  
	  RBI also runs the NAMCABS[<sup>4</sup>](https://website.rbi.org.in/en/web/rbi/-/speeches-interview/#_ftn4) program, which familiarises bankers with the specific credit needs of the MSME sector, helping to improve their understanding and support for MSME financing
	  
	  alongside government schemes like MUDRA and CGTMSE, have significantly improved formal credit to the MSME sector
	  
	  As of March 31, 2024, **credit outstanding by scheduled commercial banks to MSMEs stood at ₹27.25 lakh cro**
	  
	  growing integration of MSMEs into the formal financial ecosystem
	  
	  outstanding bank credit to MSMEs have registered an annual growth of **12.39 and 20.58** percent, respectively, in the last two financial years.
	  
	  **What can MSMEs do?**
	  
	  *Embrace formalisation*
	  
	  MSMEs operate informally, making it challenging for lenders to assess their creditworthiness
	  
	  information asymmetry, particularly regarding their financial performance
	  
	  registering on the **Udyam Portal and filing GST returns,**
	  
	  transparency over their level of business activity and financial
	  
	  by reinforcing their trustworthiness in the eyes of financial institutions
	  
	  MSMEs should maintain comprehensive and accurate financial records which is essential for seeking credibility with lenders.
	  
	  MSMEs should adopt proper accounting practices,
	  
	  ensuring their financial records, such as income statements, balance sheets, and cash flow statements are accurate and reliable
	  
	  Having financial statements prepared by certified professionals and audited by qualified auditors shall further bolster their credibility
	  
	  adopting digital payment systems like UPI and online banking creates a digital footprint of financial transactions,
	  
	  Digital payments also improve cash flow management, offering MSMEs greater control over their finances and helping them maintain a clear financial record.
	  
	  *Credit Discipline*
	  
	  credit discipline which starts with careful selection of the appropriate credit product suited to their requirements and cash flows
	  
	  familiarise themselves with different credit products such as term loans, working capital loans, overdrafts, and invoice discounting to match them with their borrowing needs.
	  
	  tailor borrowing to business cycles and avoid over-leveraging
	  
	  use the bank funds for the purposes for which it was borrowed.
	  
	  however, it is noticed that working capital funds are diverted for other purposes.
	  
	  *Capacity Building*
	  
	  SMEs must invest in capacity building to strengthen their operational and financial management skills. Financial literacy programs help entrepreneurs understand credit appraisal processes, banking norms and government support measures, making them more confident borrowers
	  
	  Engaging with industry bodies and trade associations provides MSMEs with mentorship, funding opportunities, and market linkages
	  
	  Collaborating with incubators and accelerators can offer access to training, networking, and funding
	  
	  fintech solutions that use alternative credit scoring based on sales patterns or supplier feedback can help MSMEs secure funding more effectively.
	  
	  MSMEs should prioritise the use of TReDS which provides a platform to access working capital by discounting invoices raised to larger buyers
	  
	  Pursuing buyers to also onboard onto TReDS ensures smoother transaction processing and timely payments
	  
	  TReDS into their operations, MSMEs can unlock liquidity, improve cash flows and build stronger trust with lender
	  
	  RBI engages with the banking community separately, particularly under the Standing Advisory Committee on MSMEs,
	  
	  delayed payments, infrastructure constraints, limited access to formal finance, low technology adoption, and a shortage of skilled labour.
	  
	  promoting financial inclusion, easing access to credit, and advocating for digitalization.
	  
	  RBI and the government have established a robust policy framework, including priority sector lending, collateral-free loans, digital platforms like TReDS, and capacity-building initiatives, it is equally important for MSMEs to make the most of these opportunities
	  
	  sustained collaboration among all stakeholders will be crucial to ensuring the continued growth and resilience of this vital sector.
