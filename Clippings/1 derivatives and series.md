**Problem**

$$
\lim_{x\to 0^{+}}\;
\frac{\sin\!\bigl(\,\{\sqrt{x}\}\,\bigr)}
      {\{\sqrt{x}\}}
,\qquad 
\text{where } \{t\}\text{ denotes the fractional (decimal) part of }t.
$$

---

### Step 1. Understand the fractional‚Äìpart trick near 0

For any $t$ with $0<t<1$ we have

$$
\{t\}=t,
$$

because the integer part is $0$ .  
When $x$ is very small and positive, $0<x<1\;\Longrightarrow\;0<\sqrt{x}<1$ , so

$$
\bigl\{\sqrt{x}\bigr\}=\sqrt{x}.
$$

---

### Step 2. Replace the braces with the simpler expression

Using the observation above,

$$
\frac{\sin\!\bigl(\{\sqrt{x}\}\bigr)}{\{\sqrt{x}\}}
\;=\;
\frac{\sin\!\bigl(\sqrt{x}\bigr)}{\sqrt{x}}
\quad\text{for }0<x<1.
$$

---

### Step 3. Take the limit

The right-hand side is the classic $\dfrac{\sin u}{u}$ form with $u=\sqrt{x}$ .  
As $x\to 0^{+}$ , $u=\sqrt{x}\to 0^{+}$ , and we know

$$
\lim_{u\to 0}\frac{\sin u}{u}=1.
$$

Therefore

$$
\boxed{\displaystyle
\lim_{x\to 0^{+}}
\frac{\sin\{\sqrt{x}\}}{\{\sqrt{x}\}}
=1 }.
$$

### Quick ‚Äúexam-in-30-seconds‚Äù mindset üí°

1. **Spot the braces**: Near $0$ , fractional part $\{\cdot\}$ is the number itself if the number is already between $0$ and $1$ .
2. **Recognize the $\sin u/u$ template**: The moment you rewrite it as $\sin(\sqrt{x})/\sqrt{x}$ , the limit is the famous one-liner result $=1$ .
3. **Answer and move on**: Option (b) $1$ .

That‚Äôs all‚Äîclean, quick, and no fancy detours needed.

other such identities that I shoud know

Below is a ‚Äúfirst-aid kit‚Äù of handy **limit identities & fractional-part hacks** that save precious seconds on an exam. I‚Äôve grouped them by theme, added the classic limit statement, a one-liner ‚Äúwhen it shows up,‚Äù and a micro-example so you can see the vibe.

## 1\. Small-angle trigonometry ( u‚Üí0u\\to0 )

| Identity | Statement | Spot it when‚Ä¶ | Mini-example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **(i)** $\displaystyle\lim_{u\to0}\frac{\sin u}{u}=1$ | A sine on top, the same $u$ below. | $\dfrac{\sin\sqrt{x}}{\sqrt{x}}$ as $x\to0^{+}$ . |  |
| **(ii)** $\displaystyle\lim_{u\to0}\frac{\tan u}{u}=1$ | Tangent sneaks in instead of sine. | $\dfrac{\tan(3t)}{3t}$ . |  |
| **(iii)** $\displaystyle\lim_{u\to0}\frac{1-\cos u}{u^{2}}=\tfrac12$ | ‚ÄúOne minus cos‚Äù over square. | $\dfrac{1-\cos\sqrt{x}}{x}$ . |  |
| **(iv)** $\displaystyle\lim_{u\to0}\frac{\sin au}{u}=a$ | Same as (i) but a scale $a$ . | $\dfrac{\sin(5x)}{x}\to5$ . |  |

*Eyeball cue:* always try to factor out the *exact same* $u$ that‚Äôs in the numerator‚Äôs argument.

---

## 2\. Exponential & logarithm go-to‚Äôs

| Identity | Statement | Spot it when‚Ä¶ | Mini-example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **(v)** $\displaystyle\lim_{u\to0}\frac{e^{u}-1}{u}=1$ | Exponential minus 1 upstairs. | $\dfrac{e^{\sqrt{x}}-1}{\sqrt{x}}$ . |  |
| **(vi)** $\displaystyle\lim_{u\to0}\frac{a^{u}-1}{u}=\ln a$ ( $a>0$ ) | Any other base $a$ . | $\dfrac{2^{x}-1}{x}\to\ln 2$ . |  |
| **(vii)** $\displaystyle\lim_{u\to0}\frac{\ln(1+u)}{u}=1$ | Tiny logarithm expansions. | $\dfrac{\ln(1+2x)}{2x}\to1$ . |  |
| **(viii)** $\displaystyle\lim_{n\to\infty}\bigl(1+\tfrac{u}{n}\bigr)^{n}=e^{u}$ | Sequences masquerading as powers. | $\bigl(1+\tfrac3n\bigr)^{n}\to e^{3}$ . |  |

---

## 3\. Algebraic ‚Äúbinomial-till-you-drop‚Äù rules

| Identity | Statement | Why it helps | Mini-example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **(ix)** $(1+u)^{\alpha}=1+\alpha u+o(u)$ as $u\to0$ | Binomial expansion with non-integer power $\alpha$ . | $(1+0.01)^{\sqrt2}\approx1+0.01\sqrt2$ . |  |
| **(x)** $\displaystyle\lim_{u\to0}\frac{(1+u)^{\alpha}-1}{u}=\alpha$ | Direct corollary of (ix). | $\dfrac{(1+x)^{1/3}-1}{x}\to\dfrac13$ . |  |

---

## 4\. Fractional-part ( {x}\\{x\\} ) ninja moves

| Property | Quick description | Flash use-case |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **(xi)** If $0\le x<1$ , then $\{x\}=x$ . | The trick we used in your original problem. |  |
| **(xii)** If $x=k+\varepsilon$ with $k\in\mathbb{Z}$ and $\varepsilon\in(0,1)$ , then $\{x\}=\varepsilon$ . | Near an integer, just peel off the integer part. |  |
| **(xiii)** $\{x\}+\{-x\}=1$ for non-integer $x$ . | Turns ‚Äúweird negatives‚Äù into positives: $\{-0.2\}=0.8$ . |  |
| **(xiv)** $\{x+n\}=\{x\}$ for any integer $n$ . | Shifts don‚Äôt matter; mod-1 behaviour. |  |
| **(xv)** $\bigl\{m\{x\}\bigr\} = \{mx\}$ when $m$ is an integer and the product stays in $(0,1)$ . | Helps tame nested braces. |  |

> **Speed tip:** Whenever you see braces, ask ‚ÄúIs the stuff inside already between $0$ and $1$ (or an integer ¬± tiny bit)?‚Äù‚Äîthat usually collapses the problem.

## 5\. Other ‚Äúcelebrity‚Äù limits worth memorising

| Identity | Statement | Quick note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **(xvi)** $\displaystyle\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{\sin n}{n}=0$ | Any bounded numerator over unbounded denom ‚Üí 0. |  |
| **(xvii)** $\displaystyle\lim_{u\to0}\frac{\arcsin u}{u}=1$ (same for $\arctan u$ ). | Inverses mimic their originals. |  |
| **(xviii)** $\displaystyle\lim_{u\to0}\frac{\sinh u}{u}=1,\quad\lim_{u\to0}\frac{\tanh u}{u}=1$ . | Hyperbolic cousins. |  |
| **(xix)** $\displaystyle\lim_{u\to0}\frac{\Gamma(1+u)-1}{u}=-\gamma$ (Euler‚ÄìMascheroni) | Rarely tested but nice flex. |  |
| **(xx)** Squeeze‚Äêplay classic: if $g(u)\le f(u)\le h(u)$ and $\lim g=\lim h=L$ , then $\lim f=L$ . | Used to *prove* (i)‚Äì(iii) originally. |  |

## 6\. How to drill them (30-second playbook)

1. **Flash-cards**: Write the raw formula on one side, put a *pattern* on the back (‚Äúsin over same argument‚Äù).
2. **One-liner derivations**: Know *why* each holds‚Äîusually Taylor series or the binomial theorem‚Äîso you can rebuild them if you blank out.
3. **Daily warm-ups**: Do 5 random tiny-angle or fractional-part limits each morning; muscle memory kicks in fast.
4. **Pattern-spotting game**: While practising past papers, highlight any expression that can be massaged into one of (i)‚Äì(xx). After a week you‚Äôll ‚Äúsee‚Äù the template instantly.

Stick these in your mental toolbox and most ‚Äúsneaky-looking‚Äù limit puzzles deflate to a one-liner‚Äîand you can bank those saved minutes for the nastier proofs later on. Happy crunching!

One-liner derivations: Know why each holds‚Äîusually Taylor series or the binomial theorem‚Äîso you can rebuild them if you blank out. What does this meanin

### ‚ÄúOne-liner derivation‚Äù‚Äîwhat I meant üï∂Ô∏è

When I said *‚Äúknow the one-liner derivation so you can rebuild it if you blank out,‚Äù* I was talking about having a **micro-proof** in your back pocket‚Äîsomething you can recreate in < 15 seconds by writing just one or two algebraic lines.

The cheat code is: **remember the first couple of terms of a Taylor/Maclaurin series (or the binomial expansion) and plug them straight into the limit.** Because the denominator is usually a power of the same small variable $u$ , those leading terms instantly cancel or simplify, leaving the answer in plain sight.

Below are the classic identities from the list and their ‚Äúone-liner‚Äù rebuilds.

---

## 1\. Small-angle trig limits

**Mental note:***All three are just ‚Äútake the first term of the series and divide.‚Äù*

---

## 2\. Exponential & log limits

| Limit | Tiny expansion | One-liner |
| --- | --- | --- |
| $\displaystyle\lim_{u\to0}\frac{e^{u}-1}{u}=1$ | $e^{u}=1+u+\dfrac{u^{2}}{2!}+\dots$ | $\dfrac{(1+u+\dots)-1}{u}=1+\dfrac{u}{2}+\dots\to1$ |
| $\displaystyle\lim_{u\to0}\frac{a^{u}-1}{u}=\ln a$ | Write $a^{u}=e^{u\ln a}=1+u\ln a+\dots$ | $\dfrac{1+u\ln a+\dots-1}{u}\to\ln a$ |
| $\displaystyle\lim_{u\to0}\frac{\ln(1+u)}{u}=1$ | $\ln(1+u)=u-\dfrac{u^{2}}{2}+\dots$ | $\dfrac{u-\frac{u^{2}}{2}+\dots}{u}\to1$ |

---

## 3\. Binomial-style limits

> **Formula:** For any real power $\alpha$ ,
> 
> $$
> (1+u)^{\alpha}=1+\alpha u+\frac{\alpha(\alpha-1)}{2}u^{2}+o(u^{2}).
> $$

| Limit | One-liner proof |
| --- | --- |
| $\displaystyle\lim_{u\to0}\frac{(1+u)^{\alpha}-1}{u}=\alpha$ | Plug expansion: $\dfrac{1+\alpha u+\dots-1}{u}\to\alpha$ . |

This works for integer, fractional, negative‚Äîany $\alpha$ you fancy.

---

## 4\. Fractional-part quickies

Example:

$$
\lim_{h\to0^{+}}\frac{\sin\{\sqrt{h}\}}{\{\sqrt{h}\}}
$$

We used that for $0<h<1$ , $\{\sqrt{h}\}=\sqrt{h}$ . That **single observation** collapses the braces, and the limit reverts to the small-angle identity you already know.

**Why remember it?** Because if you blank on the exact brace property, you can recreate it: *fractional part is literally the distance to the previous integer.* For $0<z<1$ , that distance is $z$ itself‚Äîno memory trick, just the definition.

---

## 5\. The ‚Äúderivative at zero‚Äù shortcut (meta-view)

If you ever forget a limit of the form

$$
\lim_{u\to0}\frac{f(u)-f(0)}{u-0},
$$

just recall the definition of the derivative: it **is** $f'(0)$ , provided $f$ is differentiable at $0$ .

- For $f(u)=\sin u$ with $f(0)=0$ , $f'(0)=\cos0=1$ .
- For $f(u)=e^{u}$ with $f(0)=1$ , rewrite as $\dfrac{e^{u}-1}{u}$ ; $f'(0)=e^{0}=1$ .
- For $f(u)=a^{u}=e^{u\ln a}$ , $f'(0)=\ln a$ .

That‚Äôs literally a one-liner: *‚ÄúDerivative at zero ‚áí answer.‚Äù*

---

## How to memorise and rebuild

1. **Keep the first two terms** of each expansion on a flashcard.
2. **Label the denominator** in your mind‚Äîusually the same $u$ or $u^{2}$ .
3. **Cross-out & evaluate.** If you forget the constant, derive it in real time by differentiating $f$ at $0$ .
4. **Practice blank-sheet drills:** write identity ‚áí cover ‚áí derive in ‚â§ 15 s.

Do that for a week and the limits stop being facts to recall‚Äîthey become micro-calculations you can re-create anytime, even under exam pressure.

1/2

how to know these series expansion is there any trick to form them or remember them?

### 0 ‚Üí Crash-course: ‚ÄúWhere do those series even come from?‚Äù

The *only* factory is the **Taylor/Maclaurin formula**

$$
f(x)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!}\,(x-a)^{n},
\qquad
\text{(pick }a=0\text{ ‚áí Maclaurin).}
$$

Everything else‚Äîsin x, cos x, eÀ£, (1+x)^Œ±, log(1+x)‚Ä¶‚Äîis just ‚Äúplug-in derivatives at 0 and stop when you‚Äôre happy.‚Äù

But in an exam you don‚Äôt have time to re-differentiate six times. So here are *three* practical ways to **generate or recall** the first two‚Äìthree terms almost instantly.

---

## 1\. ‚ÄúDerivative grid‚Äù: one scribble ‚áí all the big four

| n | f(0) | f‚Ä≤(0) | f‚Ä≥(0) | f‚Ä¥(0) | Pattern |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **eÀ£** | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | ‚Äúall ones‚Äù |
| **sin x** | 0 | 1 | 0 | ‚Äì1 | 0,1,0,‚Äì1, repeat |
| **cos x** | 1 | 0 | ‚Äì1 | 0 | 1,0,‚Äì1,0, repeat |
| **ln(1+x)** | 0 | 1 | ‚Äì1 | 2 | Alt sign factorial-ish |

**How to use:**

1. Draw the mini-table (literally 10 s).
2. Slot each number into $x^{n}/n!$ .
3. Stop after the power you need.

*Example:* sin x

$$
\sin x = 0 + 1\frac{x}{1!} + 0\frac{x^{2}}{2!} -1\frac{x^{3}}{3!}+\cdots
       = x-\frac{x^{3}}{6}+O(x^{5}).
$$

One glance, no memory.

## 2\. ‚ÄúOdd-even‚Äù mnemonics (good for trigs)

| Function | Powers that appear | Signs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| sin x | **Odd** only: 1, 3, 5,‚Ä¶ | +, ‚Äì, +, ‚Äì‚Ä¶ |
| cos x | **Even** only: 0, 2, 4,‚Ä¶ | +, ‚Äì, +, ‚Äì‚Ä¶ |
| tan x | Odd (messy coeffs) | +, +,‚Ä¶ |
| sinh x | Odd, all **positive** | +, +, +‚Ä¶ |
| cosh x | Even, all **positive** | +, +, +‚Ä¶ |

üå∂ **Mnemonic:** ‚ÄúSin is an *odd* guy, Cos an *even* lady.‚Äù

Once you know the *type* of powers and that coefficients are $1/n!$ for sin & cos, filling in $1,1/6,1/120,\dots$ is automatic.

---

## 3\. ‚ÄúBinomial hack‚Äù for any (1+x)Œ±(1+x)^{\\alpha}

The generalised binomial theorem:

$$
(1+x)^{\alpha}=1+\alpha x+\frac{\alpha(\alpha-1)}{2!}x^{2}
+\frac{\alpha(\alpha-1)(\alpha-2)}{3!}x^{3}+\cdots
$$

**Quick build:**

- First term $=1$ .
- Coefficient of $x$ is always $\alpha$ .
- Then just ‚Äúwalk down‚Äù by 1 each time in the numerator.

*If $\alpha=-1$* you instantly get the geometric series $(1+x)^{-1}=1-x+x^{2}-x^{3}+\dots$ .

**Need tan x?** Use the identity $\tan x = \dfrac{\sin x}{\cos x}$ and divide two known series; first two terms pop out after one long-division line.

---

## 4\. Speed-derivation drills (15-second rule)

1. **Write $f(0)$ and $f'(0)$** ‚Äîthat alone gives you the limit $\dfrac{f(x)-f(0)}{x}\sim f'(0)$ .
2. **Add one more derivative** if you need a second-order term (e.g., $1-\cos x$ ).
3. **Stop.** Beyond the cube term almost no entrance test asks.

---

## 5\. Memory snapshots (if you really just want to memorize)

- **eÀ£:** ‚Äú1 + x + x¬≤/2 + x¬≥/6 ‚Ä¶‚Äù (all +, factorial denominator).
- **sin:** Take eÀ£, keep odd powers, alternate signs starting +.
- **cos:** Take eÀ£, keep even powers, alternate signs starting +.
- **ln(1+x):** ‚Äúx ‚Äì x¬≤/2 + x¬≥/3 ‚Äì ‚Ä¶‚Äù (coeff = 1/n, alt signs).
- **(1+x)·µÖ:** First two coefficients $1, Œ±$ ; every next term multiplies previous numerator by $(Œ±-k+1)/k$ .

Stick these five in a flash-card and 90 % of common limits are yours.

---

## 6\. Two practice strokes to lock it in

1. **Blank-sheet test**: each morning rewrite sin x & eÀ£ up to x¬≥ without notes. Time yourself (goal < 20 s).
2. **Derivative check**: pick a random function, compute f‚Ä≤(0) ‚Üí derive the limit $\dfrac{f(x)-f(0)}{x}$ . This cements the derivative-limit connection.

---

### TL;DR

- **You don‚Äôt ‚Äúmemorise‚Äù long series‚Äîyou memorise their *rule* or the first derivative or two.**
- **Derivative at 0 = first non-trivial coefficient.**
- **Odd/even and sign patterns act as mental safety-nets.**

Do these micro-drills for a week and the expansions will feel as natural as the times-tables you‚Äôve known since grade school.
