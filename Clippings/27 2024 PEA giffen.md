Let’s dive into this economics question about consumer behavior. We’re told that a consumer consumes two goods, X and Y, and there’s an interesting observation: whenever the price of good X falls, the consumer’s consumption of X always decreases, assuming all other factors remain constant (ceteris paribus). Now, we need to figure out what happens to the consumption of X when the consumer’s income rises, while the prices of X and Y stay the same. The options are: (A) consumption of X falls, (B) consumption of X rises, (C) consumption of X remains unchanged, or (D) it’s indeterminate. Let’s break this down step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyzing the Initial Observation

The key clue is that when the price of X falls, the consumer buys less of X, ceteris paribus. In standard economics, the law of demand tells us that when a good’s price decreases, people usually buy more of it because it’s cheaper relative to other goods (the substitution effect) and because their purchasing power increases (the income effect). However, here, consumption falls instead. This is unusual and suggests that good X doesn’t follow typical demand patterns.

This behavior is characteristic of a **Giffen good**. A Giffen good is a rare type of inferior good where, when its price drops, the consumer buys less of it. To understand why, let’s consider the two effects at play when the price of X falls:

- **Substitution Effect**: A lower price for X makes it cheaper compared to Y, encouraging the consumer to buy more X. This effect is always positive (increases consumption).
- **Income Effect**: A lower price increases the consumer’s real income (they can buy more with the same money). For a normal good, this boosts consumption, but for an **inferior good**, higher income leads to lower consumption because the consumer shifts to preferred alternatives.

For most goods, these effects reinforce each other, increasing consumption as price falls. But for a Giffen good, the income effect is negative (because it’s inferior) and so strong that it outweighs the positive substitution effect, resulting in reduced consumption. The observation that consumption of X “always falls” when its price drops strongly suggests X is a Giffen good, and thus an inferior good.

### Step 2: Shifting to the Income Increase Scenario

Now, the question asks what happens when the consumer’s income rises, with the prices of X and Y unchanged. Here, there’s no price change, so the substitution effect isn’t relevant—only the income effect matters. The income effect depends on the type of good:

- **Normal Good**: As income rises, consumption increases.
- **Inferior Good**: As income rises, consumption decreases because the consumer can now afford better alternatives.
- **Giffen Good**: A subset of inferior goods, exhibiting the same negative income effect when income changes directly.

Since we’ve established that X is likely a Giffen good (and thus inferior) based on the price-drop behavior, we need to apply this to the income increase. For an inferior good, when income rises, the consumer tends to reduce consumption of that good, opting for substitutes they perceive as higher quality or more desirable.

### Step 3: Applying the Income Effect to Good X

Given that X’s consumption falls when its price falls (indicating a strong negative income effect typical of a Giffen good), an increase in income, with prices fixed, should also reduce consumption of X. Why? Because the consumer now has more money and, if X is inferior, they’ll likely spend it on other goods (like Y or something else) rather than X. This aligns with the definition of an inferior good: higher income shifts demand away from it.

### Step 4: Considering Alternatives

Could X be something other than a Giffen good? If X were a normal good, consumption would rise with income, but that contradicts the initial observation (consumption falling when price falls). If the income effect were zero, consumption might stay unchanged, but Giffen goods have a pronounced negative income effect. The “ceteris paribus” condition rules out external factors like preferences changing or constraints, leaving us with standard consumer theory, where this behavior points to an inferior, Giffen good.

### Step 5: Conclusion

When the consumer’s income rises and prices remain constant, the consumption of X, an inferior good (specifically a Giffen good), will decrease due to the negative income effect. Among the options—(A) falls, (B) rises, (C) remains unchanged, (D) indeterminate—option (A) matches our analysis.

**Answer**: Consumption of X falls.

how to deal with these sort of questions that come in the ISI MSQE papers

Dealing with questions from the ISI MSQE (Indian Statistical Institute Master of Science in Quantitative Economics) entrance exam can feel daunting due to their challenging nature, which often blends economic theory, mathematics, and logical reasoning. However, with a structured approach, you can tackle them effectively. Below is a comprehensive guide to help you navigate these questions:

---

### 1\. Understand the Question Type

ISI MSQE questions vary in format—they might be purely theoretical, heavily mathematical, or a combination of both. Your first task is to determine what the question demands:

- **Direct Answer**: A specific value or choice (e.g., multiple-choice options).
- **Explanation**: A qualitative discussion of economic phenomena.
- **Derivation**: A step-by-step mathematical solution.

Take a moment to classify the question before diving in—it sets the tone for your approach.

---

### 2\. Break Down the Problem

Complex questions become manageable when you dissect them:

- **Read Carefully**: Every word matters. Terms like "always," "never," or "ceteris paribus" can change the meaning entirely.
- **Identify Key Concepts**: Pinpoint the economic principles at play—consumer theory, market equilibrium, game theory, etc.
- **List Given Information**: Jot down all variables, conditions, and assumptions provided in the question.

This step ensures you’re clear on what’s being asked and what tools you’ll need.

---

### 3\. Recall Relevant Economic Theories

The ISI MSQE tests your grasp of core economics. Depending on the question, you might need to draw from:

- **Consumer Theory**: Utility maximization, demand curves, income and substitution effects.
- **Producer Theory**: Cost minimization, profit maximization, production functions.
- **Market Structures**: Perfect competition, monopoly, oligopoly behavior.
- **Game Theory**: Nash equilibrium, dominant strategies.
- **Macroeconomics**: GDP, inflation, fiscal policy impacts.

Quickly connect the question to the right framework to guide your solution.

---

### 4\. Apply the Theories

Once you’ve identified the concepts, put them to work:

- **Use Diagrams**: Sketch indifference curves, budget lines, or supply-demand graphs if the question involves relationships you can visualize.
- **Set Up Equations**: For mathematical questions, translate the problem into equations (e.g., maximize utility $U(x, y)$  subject to $p_x x + p_y y = I$  ).
- **Reason Logically**: For theoretical questions, build your argument step-by-step, ensuring it aligns with economic principles.

This is where your preparation meets the problem—be methodical.

---

### 5\. Watch for Special Cases

ISI questions often include twists that test deeper understanding:

- **Giffen Goods**: Where demand rises as price increases due to a strong income effect.
- **Externalities**: Market failures requiring adjustments to standard models.
- **Asymmetry**: Scenarios involving imperfect information (e.g., signaling or moral hazard).

If the question deviates from standard assumptions, adjust your approach accordingly.

---

### 6\. Avoid Traps

The exam may throw curveballs:

- **Red Herrings**: Extra details that don’t affect the solution—ignore them.
- **Hidden Assumptions**: Look for unstated conditions that might influence the answer.

Stay focused on what’s essential to avoid getting sidetracked.

---

### 7\. Verify Your Answer

Before finalizing:

- **Check Consistency**: Does your answer make sense in the context of economic theory?
- **Validate Calculations**: Ensure units match and numbers align (if applicable).
- **Analyze Options**: For multiple-choice questions, eliminate implausible answers to confirm your choice.

This step catches errors and boosts confidence in your solution.

---

### 8\. Build Skills Through Practice

To master this approach:

- **Solve Past Papers**: Familiarize yourself with question patterns and difficulty levels.
- **Focus on Concepts**: Deep understanding trumps memorization—know *why* theories work.
- **Practice Time Management**: Simulate exam conditions to improve speed and accuracy.

Regular practice hones your ability to apply this method under pressure.

### Example in Action

Consider this sample question:  
*A consumer consumes two goods, X and Y. Whenever the price of X falls, the consumer’s consumption of X always falls, ceteris paribus. Now, if the consumer’s income rises while prices remain unchanged, what happens to the consumption of X? (A) Falls, (B) Rises, (C) Remains unchanged, (D) Indeterminate.*

- **Step 1**: This is a consumer theory question with a multiple-choice answer.
- **Step 2**: Key info—consumption of X falls when its price drops (unusual behavior); income rises, prices constant.
- **Step 3**: Recall the law of demand (price down, consumption up) and exceptions like Giffen goods (price down, consumption down due to inferiority).
- **Step 4**: Since X’s consumption falls with a price drop, X is likely a Giffen good, which is inferior. When income rises, demand for inferior goods falls.
- **Step 5**: No special cases beyond Giffen behavior.
- **Step 6**: No irrelevant info here.
- **Step 7**: Answer (A) “falls” aligns with inferior good behavior.

Answer: Consumption of X falls.
