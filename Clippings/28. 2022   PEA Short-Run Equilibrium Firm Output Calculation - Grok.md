To determine the short-run equilibrium output for each firm in an industry with $m$  identical competitive firms, we start by analyzing the given information: each firm has a total cost function $C(q) = q^2 + 1$  , where $q$  is the firm's output, and the industry demand is $D(P) = a - bP$  , with $a$  and $b$  being positive constants. Our goal is to find the output $q$  per firm in the short-run equilibrium, choosing from the options: (A) 0, (B) $\frac{a}{m + 2b}$  , (C) $\frac{a}{2 + b}$  , or (D) $\frac{a}{m + \frac{b}{2}}$  .

### Step 1: Firm's Supply Function

In a perfectly competitive market, firms are price takers and produce where their marginal cost equals the market price in the short run, provided the price exceeds the average variable cost (AVC). Let’s compute the marginal cost (MC) from the total cost function:

- Total cost: $C(q) = q^2 + 1$
- Marginal cost: $MC = \frac{dC}{dq} = 2q$

Thus, for each firm, the equilibrium condition is:

$P = MC = 2q$

Solving for $q$  :

$q = \frac{P}{2}$

This is the individual firm’s supply function, but we must ensure production is viable by checking AVC:

- Variable cost = $q^2$  (since the fixed cost is 1)
- AVC = $\frac{q^2}{q} = q$
- Since $MC = 2q$  and $AVC = q$  , we have $2q > q$  for $q > 0$  , so $P = 2q > AVC$  whenever $q > 0$  .

Thus, firms will produce positive output as long as $P > 0$  , and the supply function $q = \frac{P}{2}$  holds.

### Step 2: Industry Supply

With $m$  identical firms, the industry supply is the sum of each firm’s output:

- Individual supply: $q = \frac{P}{2}$
- Industry supply: $S(P) = m \cdot q = m \cdot \frac{P}{2} = \frac{m P}{2}$

### Step 3: Market Equilibrium

In equilibrium, industry supply equals industry demand:

- Demand: $D(P) = a - bP$
- Supply: $S(P) = \frac{m P}{2}$

Set them equal:

$\frac{m P}{2} = a - bP$

Solve for $P$  :

- Multiply both sides by 2: $m P = 2a - 2bP$
- Add $2bP$  to both sides: $m P + 2bP = 2a$
- Factor out $P$  : $P (m + 2b) = 2a$
- Solve: $P = \frac{2a}{m + 2b}$

Since $a > 0$  , $b > 0$  , and $m > 0$  , $P > 0$  , which is consistent with positive production.

### Step 4: Equilibrium Output per Firm

Using the firm’s supply function with the equilibrium price:

$q = \frac{P}{2} = \frac{\frac{2a}{m + 2b}}{2} = \frac{2a}{2 (m + 2b)} = \frac{a}{m + 2b}$

### Step 5: Verify with Options

Compare with the options:

- (A) 0: Implies no production, but $P > 0$  and $a > 0$  suggest positive output.
- (B) $\frac{a}{m + 2b}$  : Matches our result.
- (C) $\frac{a}{2 + b}$  : Independent of $m$  , but output should decrease as $m$  increases, so this is unlikely.
- (D) $\frac{a}{m + \frac{b}{2}}$  : Let’s test consistency later.

### Step 6: Alternative Approach (Consistency Check)

Using the inverse demand function:

- $D(P) = a - bP$  , so $P = \frac{a - Q}{b}$  , where $Q = m q$
- Firm condition: $P = 2q$
- Substitute: $2q = \frac{a - m q}{b}$
- Multiply by $b$  : $2q b = a - m q$
- Rearrange: $2q b + m q = a$
- Factor: $q (2b + m) = a$
- Solve: $q = \frac{a}{2b + m} = \frac{a}{m + 2b}$

This confirms our earlier result.

### Step 7: Numerical Check

For $m = 1$  , $a = 10$  , $b = 1$  :

- $q = \frac{10}{1 + 2 \cdot 1} = \frac{10}{3}$
- $Q = m q = 1 \cdot \frac{10}{3} = \frac{10}{3}$
- $P = 2q = 2 \cdot \frac{10}{3} = \frac{20}{3}$
- Demand check: $P = \frac{a - Q}{b} = \frac{10 - \frac{10}{3}}{1} = \frac{20}{3}$  , which matches.

For $m = 2$  :

- $q = \frac{10}{2 + 2 \cdot 1} = \frac{10}{4} = 2.5$
- $Q = 2 \cdot 2.5 = 5$
- $P = 2 \cdot 2.5 = 5$
- $P = \frac{10 - 5}{1} = 5$  , which matches.

Option (D) gives $q = \frac{10}{1 + \frac{1}{2}} = \frac{20}{3}$  for $m = 1$  , leading to $P = \frac{40}{3}$  but demand $P = \frac{10 - \frac{20}{3}}{1} = \frac{10}{3}$  , a contradiction.

### Conclusion

The short-run equilibrium output per firm is $\frac{a}{m + 2b}$  , corresponding to option (B).

### What the Fuck is Perfect Competition?

Perfect competition is this idealized, no-fucks-given market where a shitload of tiny-ass firms sell identical crap—think potatoes or some basic shit. No barriers to entry or exit, so any dumbass can jump in or bail out. Every firm’s a price taker, meaning they can’t jack up the price like some wannabe kingpin. The market sets the price, and you either take it or fuck off. It’s like being a small-time hustler in a massive game—you don’t control shit.

### The Firm’s Game Plan: Where Math Kicks In

Each firm’s got a cost structure, and we’re gonna break it down hard. Say the total cost is $C(q)$  , where $q$  is how much shit they churn out. From that, you get:

- **Marginal Cost (MC)**: $MC = \frac{dC}{dq}$  . This is the extra cost of making one more unit. In perfect competition, firms produce where **$P = MC$** . That’s the fucking gospel. If you don’t get this, you’re screwed.
- **Average Cost (AC)**: $AC = \frac{C(q)}{q}$  . Total cost divided by output. Tells you the cost per unit.
- **Average Variable Cost (AVC)**: Variable cost over $q$  . This matters for short-run decisions—if $P < AVC$  , you’re better off shutting down than bleeding cash.

#### Example Cost Function

Take $C(q) = q^2 + q + 1$  :

- **MC**: $\frac{d}{dq}(q^2 + q + 1) = 2q$
- **AC**: $\frac{q^2 + q + 1}{q} = q + 1 + \frac{1}{q}$
- **AVC**: Variable cost is $q^2 + q$  , so $AVC = \frac{q^2 + q}{q} = q + 1$

In the short run, the firm maximizes profit where $P = MC$  . So, $P = 2q$  , and $q = \frac{P}{2}$  . But here’s the kicker: they only produce if $P$  covers $AVC$  at that $q$  , otherwise they shut down and eat the fixed cost (here, 1).

Profit’s $\pi = P q - C(q)$  . Optimize it: $\pi = P q - q^2 - q - 1$  , take the derivative: $P - 2q - 1 = 0$  , so $q = \frac{P - 1}{2}$  (if $P > 1$  , else $q = 0$  ). Check if it beats shutting down ( $\pi = -1$  ):

- At $q = \frac{P - 1}{2}$  , $\pi = P \cdot \frac{P - 1}{2} - \left( \frac{P - 1}{2} \right)^2 - \frac{P - 1}{2} - 1 = \frac{P^2 - 5}{4}$  .
- If $P = 1.5$  , $q = 0.25$  , $\pi = -0.9375 > -1$  , so produce. If $P < 1$  , $q = 0$  , $\pi = -1$  .

**Supply Function**: $q = \max\left(0, \frac{P - 1}{2}\right)$  . That’s the firm’s play.

### Short-Run Equilibrium: Industry-Level Hustle

In the short run, you’ve got $m$  firms, each with that supply function. Industry supply is $S(P) = m \cdot q(P) = m \cdot \frac{P - 1}{2}$  (for $P > 1$  , else 0). Demand’s some shit like $D(P) = a - bP$  . Equilibrium’s where $S(P) = D(P)$  :

- $m \cdot \frac{P - 1}{2} = a - bP$
- Solve: $\frac{m}{2}P - \frac{m}{2} = a - bP$
- $P\left( \frac{m}{2} + b \right) = a + \frac{m}{2}$
- $P = \frac{a + \frac{m}{2}}{\frac{m}{2} + b} = \frac{2a + m}{m + 2b}$

Each firm produces $q = \frac{P - 1}{2}$  , and profit depends on $P$  vs. $AC$  . If $P > AC$  , they’re raking it in; if $P < AC$  , they’re losing but might still produce if $P > AVC$  .

### Long-Run Equilibrium: The Zero-Profit Grind

In the long run, firms enter or exit until profit’s zero, meaning $P = \min AC$  . For our cost:

- $AC = q + 1 + \frac{1}{q}$  , minimize by derivative: $1 - \frac{1}{q^2} = 0$  , $q = 1$  , so $\min AC = 1 + 1 + 1 = 2$  .
- Set $P = MC = AC$  : $2q = 2$  , $q = 1$  , confirms $P = 2$  .

Industry supply becomes perfectly elastic at $P = 2$  . Quantity supplied is $D(2) = a - 2b$  , and number of firms $m = \frac{a - 2b}{1} = a - 2b$  (assuming $a > 2b$  , else no positive output).

### Welfare: Who Gets the Cash?

Perfect competition’s efficient as fuck:

- **Consumer Surplus (CS)**: Area above $P$  under demand. For $D(P) = a - bP$  , at equilibrium $P$  , $CS = \frac{(a - bP)^2}{2b}$  .
- **Producer Surplus (PS)**: Below $P$  , above supply. In long run, $P = AC$  , so $PS = 0$  . Short run, $PS = m \cdot (P - AC) q$  if $P > AC$  .
- **Total Surplus**: $TS = CS + PS$  . Maximized in perfect competition—no deadweight loss.

### Key Shit to Know

1. **Firm’s Rule**: $P = MC$  , produce if $P \geq AVC$  , else shut down.
2. **Short Run**: Fixed $m$  , solve $S(P) = D(P)$  .
3. **Long Run**: $P = \min AC$  , $m$  adjusts.
4. **Math Tools**: Derive $MC$  , $AC$  , $AVC$  ; solve equilibria; compute $\pi$  , $CS$  , $PS$  .
5. **Efficiency**: Allocative ( $P = MC$  ) and productive ( $P = \min AC$  ).

### Solving Any Damn Problem

- **Step 1**: Get the cost function, derive $MC$  , $AVC$  , $AC$  .
- **Step 2**: Firm supply: $q$  where $P = MC$  , check $P \geq AVC$  .
- **Step 3**: Industry supply: $S(P) = m \cdot q(P)$  .
- **Step 4**: Equilibrium: $S(P) = D(P)$  .
- **Step 5**: Long run? $P = \min AC$  , adjust $m$  .
- **Step 6**: Welfare? Compute $CS$  , $PS$  , check efficiency.

So there you go, assholes. Perfect competition’s a brutal game—firms grind where $P = MC$  , short-run profits get eaten up in the long run, and efficiency reigns supreme. Master this shit, and you’ll crush those ISI MSQE papers like a fucking boss. Peace out. https://grok.com/chat/f32ea378-825d-459f-a329-8d5e2041a601
