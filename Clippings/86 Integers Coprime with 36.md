To determine how many integers $n$  satisfy $2 \leq n \leq 1000$  and have a highest common factor (HCF) of 1 with 36, we need to count the integers in this range that are coprime with 36. Two numbers are coprime if their greatest common divisor (GCD) is 1, meaning they share no common prime factors. Let’s solve this step-by-step.

### Step 1: Understand the Range and Condition

The range $2 \leq n \leq 1000$  includes all integers from 2 to 1000, inclusive. That’s:

- Smallest number: 2
- Largest number: 1000
- Total count of integers: $1000 - 2 + 1 = 999$

We need to find how many of these 999 integers are coprime with 36.

### Step 2: Factorize 36

Since the condition involves the HCF with 36, let’s factorize 36 into its prime factors:

- $36 = 2^2 \times 3^2 = 4 \times 9$

The prime factors of 36 are 2 and 3. For $n$  to be coprime with 36, $n$  must not be divisible by 2 or 3, because if $n$  shares either prime factor with 36, their GCD would be at least 2 or 3, not 1.

### Step 3: Use Inclusion-Exclusion Principle

To count numbers coprime with 36, it’s easier to calculate the numbers that are *not* coprime with 36 (i.e., those divisible by 2 or 3) and subtract them from the total. We’ll use the inclusion-exclusion principle over the range from 2 to 1000.

- **Total numbers from 2 to 1000**: 999 (as calculated above).
- **Numbers divisible by 2** (multiples of 2):
	- Sequence: 2, 4, 6,..., 1000
	- This is an arithmetic sequence with first term 2, common difference 2.
	- Largest multiple of 2 ≤ 1000 is 1000.
	- Number of terms: $\lfloor 1000 / 2 \rfloor = 500$  .
- **Numbers divisible by 3** (multiples of 3):
	- Sequence: 3, 6, 9,..., 999 (since 1002 > 1000)
	- Largest multiple of 3 ≤ 1000 is 999 (check: $999 = 3 \times 333$  , $1002 = 3 \times 334 > 1000$  ).
	- Number of terms: $\lfloor 1000 / 3 \rfloor = 333$  .
- **Numbers divisible by 6** (multiples of 6, since $6 = 2 \times 3$  ):
	- Sequence: 6, 12, 18,..., 996 (since 1002 > 1000)
	- Largest multiple of 6 ≤ 1000 is 996 (check: $996 = 6 \times 166$  , $1002 = 6 \times 167 > 1000$  ).
	- Number of terms: $\lfloor 1000 / 6 \rfloor = 166$  .

Now, apply inclusion-exclusion to find numbers divisible by 2 or 3:

- $|A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B|$
- Where $|A| =$  numbers divisible by 2 = 500
- $|B| =$  numbers divisible by 3 = 333
- $|A \cap B| =$  numbers divisible by 6 = 166
- Total = $500 + 333 - 166 = 833 - 166 = 667$

So, 667 numbers from 2 to 1000 are divisible by 2 or 3.

### Step 4: Calculate Numbers Coprime with 36

- Numbers not divisible by 2 or 3 = Total - Numbers divisible by 2 or 3
- $999 - 667 = 332$

Thus, 332 numbers from 2 to 1000 are coprime with 36.

### Step 5: Alternative Approach (From 1 to 1000, Adjust for 2 to 1000)

Let’s confirm using the range 1 to 1000, then adjust:

- Total from 1 to 1000: 1000 numbers.
- Divisible by 2: $\lfloor 1000 / 2 \rfloor = 500$
- Divisible by 3: $\lfloor 1000 / 3 \rfloor = 333$
- Divisible by 6: $\lfloor 1000 / 6 \rfloor = 166$
- Divisible by 2 or 3: $500 + 333 - 166 = 667$
- Coprime with 36: $1000 - 667 = 333$

This counts numbers from 1 to 1000 coprime with 36, including $n = 1$  (GCD(1, 36) = 1). Since the problem starts at 2, exclude $n = 1$  :

- $333 - 1 = 332$

Check $n = 1000$  : $1000 = 2^3 \times 5^3$  , GCD(1000, 36) = $2^2 = 4 \neq 1$  , so 1000 is not coprime, and our count aligns.

### Step 6: Verify with Euler’s Totient Function

In a cycle of 36 numbers, the number coprime with 36 is $\phi(36)$  :

- $\phi(36) = 36 \times (1 - \frac{1}{2}) \times (1 - \frac{1}{3}) = 36 \times \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{2}{3} = 12$
- Full cycles in 1000: $\lfloor 1000 / 36 \rfloor = 27$  (since $27 \times 36 = 972$  )
- Coprime in 27 cycles: $27 \times 12 = 324$
- Remainder: 973 to 1000 (28 numbers), equivalent to 1 to 28 modulo 36:
	- From 1 to 28, coprime: 28 - $\lfloor 28/2 \rfloor - \lfloor 28/3 \rfloor + \lfloor 28/6 \rfloor = 28 - 14 - 9 + 4 = 9$
- Total from 1 to 1000: $324 + 9 = 333$
- From 2 to 1000: $333 - 1 = 332$

### Final Answer

All methods agree: there are 332 integers from 2 to 1000 coprime with 36. Among the options (A) 166, (B) 332, (C) 361, (D) 416, the answer is (B) 332.
