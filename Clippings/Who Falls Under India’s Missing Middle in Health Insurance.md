Missing Middle?

The Missing Middle refers to a vast and varied group of individuals who are **neither poor enough to qualify for government-subsidized health insurance nor affluent enough to afford private voluntary health insurance (PVHI).** This group constitutes approximately 40 crore Indians—30% of the population—and is spread across both rural and urban settings.

Missing Middle may not fall below the poverty line, they remain highly vulnerable to financial shocks, particularly those arising from health emergencies

High Out-of-Pocket Expenditures (OOPE): This group spends a significant portion of their income on healthcare.

 Premiums for private insurance plans are often beyond their reach, with average costs ranging from ₹12,000-26,000 annually for a family of four.

 Insurance products are laden with exclusions, waiting periods, and jargon that make them difficult to understand.

 Many in this group are unaware of the benefits of health insurance or the existence of standardized products like Aarogya Sanjeevani.

 Insurers find it challenging to reach this dispersed and diverse population due to the lack of centralized databases or identifiable groupings.

Moving Toward Inclusion

 Premiums between ₹4,000-6,000 per family annually are viable for most.

 Products should cover both inpatient and outpatient care to address broader health needs.

 Reduce exclusions and waiting periods while introducing user-friendly features like cashless claims.

 Leverage existing infrastructure like the PMJAY platform to reduce costs and enhance reach.

- Thailand: Fully subsidized the informal sector to achieve universal coverage.
- China: Introduced contributory schemes with partial subsidies for rural and urban residents.
- Latin America: Integrated risk pools to ensure equitable access for both contributory and non-contributory groups. https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/who-falls-under-indias-missing-middle-health-anurag-kashyap-gd87c
