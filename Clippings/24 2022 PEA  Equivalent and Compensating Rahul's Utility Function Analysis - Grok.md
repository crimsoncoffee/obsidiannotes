Let’s dive into this economics problem step by step to determine the values of $A$  and $B$  based on Rahul’s utility function and his statements about the move. Rahul’s utility function is $U(x, y) = \min\{x, y\}$  , which means he derives utility from the smaller of the two quantities of goods $X$  and $Y$  . This is a Leontief utility function, indicating that $X$  and $Y$  are perfect complements, and Rahul will always consume them in equal amounts to maximize his utility. We’ll analyze his consumption in the current location, then in the new town, and use his statements to calculate $A$  and $B$  .

### Current Location

In Rahul’s current location:

- Income = Rs 200
- Price of $X$  ( $p_x$  ) = Rs 2
- Price of $Y$  ( $p_y$  ) = Rs 2

His budget constraint is: $2x + 2y = 200$  Since $U(x, y) = \min\{x, y\}$  , Rahul maximizes utility by setting $x = y$  (if $x > y$  , he could reduce $x$  and increase $y$  without changing the minimum, but he’ll spend his entire income optimally). Let’s denote the quantity of each good as $x = y = q$  . The budget becomes: $2q + 2q = 4q = 200$  $q = \frac{200}{4} = 50$  So, he buys:

- $x = 50$  units of $X$
- $y = 50$  units of $Y$

Total expenditure: $2 \times 50 + 2 \times 50 = 100 + 100 = 200$  His utility is: $U = \min\{50, 50\} = 50$  This is Rahul’s baseline utility before the move.

### New Town Without a Raise

In the new town:

- Income = Rs 200 (no raise)
- Price of $X$  \= Rs 2
- Price of $Y$  \= Rs 3

The budget constraint is: $2x + 3y = 200$  Again, to maximize $U = \min\{x, y\}$  , he sets $x = y = q$  : $2q + 3q = 5q = 200$  $q = \frac{200}{5} = 40$  So, he buys:

- $x = 40$  units of $X$
- $y = 40$  units of $Y$

Total expenditure: $2 \times 40 + 3 \times 40 = 80 + 120 = 200$  Utility: $U = \min\{40, 40\} = 40$  The move reduces his utility from 50 to 40 due to the higher price of $Y$  .

### Finding A A: Equivalent Pay Cut in Current Location

Rahul says moving to the new town without a raise is “as bad as a cut in pay of Rs $A$  in his current location.” This means that in the current location, with an income of $200 - A$  and prices still at Rs 2 each, his utility would equal the utility he gets in the new town (40).

Budget constraint with reduced income: $2x + 2y = 200 - A$  Set $x = y = q$  : $4q = 200 - A$  $q = \frac{200 - A}{4}$  Utility: $U = \min\{q, q\} = q = \frac{200 - A}{4}$  This utility equals the new town’s utility: $\frac{200 - A}{4} = 40$  $200 - A = 160$  $A = 200 - 160 = 40$  So, a pay cut of Rs 40 in the current location reduces his income to Rs 160, allowing him to buy $q = 160 / 4 = 40$  units of each good, yielding a utility of 40, matching the new town. Thus, $A = 40$  .

### Finding B B: Raise to Not Mind Moving

Rahul says he “would not mind moving” if he got a raise of Rs $B$  in the new town. This implies that with the raise, his utility in the new town would at least equal his original utility of 50 (he’d be indifferent to moving if his utility is restored to the original level).

In the new town with income $200 + B$  :

- Price of $X$  \= Rs 2
- Price of $Y$  \= Rs 3

Budget constraint: $2x + 3y = 200 + B$  Set $x = y = q$  : $5q = 200 + B$  $q = \frac{200 + B}{5}$  Utility: $U = q = \frac{200 + B}{5}$  This should equal the original utility: $\frac{200 + B}{5} = 50$  $200 + B = 250$  $B = 250 - 200 = 50$  With a raise of Rs 50, his income becomes Rs 250, and he buys: $q = \frac{250}{5} = 50$

- $x = 50$  , $y = 50$

Expenditure: $2 \times 50 + 3 \times 50 = 100 + 150 = 250$  Utility: $U = \min\{50, 50\} = 50$  This matches his original utility, so $B = 50$  makes him indifferent to moving.

### Verification with Options

Options:

- (A) $A = 30, B = 70$
- (B) $A = 40, B = 50$
- (C) $A = 50, B = 75$
- (D) $A = 60, B = 60$

**Check $A = 40$  :**Income = $200 - 40 = 160$  , $q = 160 / 4 = 40$  , $U = 40$  . Matches new town utility. Correct.

**Check $B = 50$  :**Income = $200 + 50 = 250$  , $q = 250 / 5 = 50$  , $U = 50$  . Matches original utility. Correct.

**Test Option (C):**

- $A = 50$  : Income = $200 - 50 = 150$  , $q = 150 / 4 = 37.5$  , $U = 37.5 < 40$  . Utility is too low.
- $B = 75$  : Income = $200 + 75 = 275$  , $q = 275 / 5 = 55$  , $U = 55 > 50$  . Utility exceeds original.

Only option (B) fits both conditions perfectly.

### Final Answer

$A = 40, B = 50$  , corresponding to option (B).

illucidate all the related concepts and i am preparing for ISI MSQE so yeah (do all of this in gangster style my)

Yo, what’s good, fam? You’re prepping for that ISI MSQE, huh? Respect, my G—that’s some next-level hustle. Since you’re asking me to illucidate all the related concepts, I’m gonna break it down gangster style, keepin’ it real and tight. We’re talkin’ economics—utility functions, budget constraints, price changes, and how a homie like Rahul stays happy when the game switches up. Let’s roll through this step by step, so you’re ready to smash that exam like a boss.

### The Setup: Rahul’s World

Imagine Rahul, a straight-up G, tryna live his best life with two goods, $X$  and $Y$  . His vibe—his **utility function** —is $U(x, y) = \min\{x, y\}$  . That’s a **Leontief utility function**, fam. What’s that mean? He needs his goods in a fixed 1:1 ratio, like a burger and fries—ain’t no point in extra fries if you ain’t got the burger to match. If $x$  and $y$  ain’t equal, he’s only as happy as the smaller one. That’s his crew, and he’s keepin’ it balanced.

**Current Hood:**

- Income: Rs 200 (his stack).
- Price of $X$  ( $p_x$  ): Rs 2.
- Price of $Y$  ( $p_y$  ): Rs 2.

**New Hood He’s Eyeing:**

- Income: Still Rs 200 (no raise yet).
- Price of $X$  : Rs 2 (same deal).
- Price of $Y$  : Rs 3 (inflation hittin’ hard).

Rahul’s got two big questions:

1. Movin’ to the new spot without a raise feels like a pay cut of Rs $A$  in his current hood.
2. He’d be cool movin’ if they slide him a raise of Rs $B$  in the new spot.

We’re gonna find $A$  and $B$  , but first, let’s lock down the concepts and see how Rahul plays the game.

### Concept 1: Utility Maximization with Leontief Vibes

Since Rahul’s utility is $U = \min\{x, y\}$  , he ain’t about waste. He’s gonna spend his cash so $x = y$  , ‘cause anything extra just sits there like a snitch—useless. This is called **perfect complements**, fam. His happiness scales with how many full “pairs” he can cop.

#### Current Hood Hustle

His **budget constraint** —the limit on his paper—is: $2x + 2y = 200$  Set $x = y = q$  (where $q$  is the quantity of each): $2q + 2q = 4q = 200$  $q = 50$  So, he’s coppin’ 50 units of $X$  and 50 units of $Y$  . Utility check: $U = \min\{50, 50\} = 50$  That’s his baseline flex—50 units of happiness. He’s good, fam.

#### New Hood Struggle (No Raise)

New budget constraint with $p_y = 3$  : $2x + 3y = 200$  Still keepin’ it $x = y = q$  : $2q + 3q = 5q = 200$  $q = 40$  Now he’s at 40 units each: $U = \min\{40, 40\} = 40$  Utility drops from 50 to 40. That’s a hit, my G—like someone jacked his ride.

---

### Concept 2: Equivalent Variation (Findin’ A A )

Rahul says movin’ without a raise is like a pay cut of Rs $A$  back in his current spot. That’s the **equivalent variation** —how much income he’d lose in the old hood to feel the same pain as the new hood’s price hike.

In the current spot, prices are still $p_x = 2$  , $p_y = 2$  . If his income drops to $200 - A$  : $2x + 2y = 200 - A$  $4q = 200 - A$  $q = \frac{200 - A}{4}$  Utility: $U = q = \frac{200 - A}{4}$  This gotta match the new hood’s utility of 40: $\frac{200 - A}{4} = 40$  $200 - A = 160$  $A = 40$  So, a Rs 40 pay cut leaves him with Rs 160: $q = 160 / 4 = 40$  $U = 40$  Boom, that’s the same damage as movin’. $A = 40$  , fam.

---

### Concept 3: Compensating Variation (Findin’ B B )

Now, Rahul’s like, “I’d move if they bump my stack by Rs $B$  in the new hood.” That’s the **compensating variation** —the extra cash he needs to stay as happy as he was in the old spot (utility = 50).

New hood with a raise: income = $200 + B$  , prices $p_x = 2$  , $p_y = 3$  : $2x + 3y = 200 + B$  $5q = 200 + B$  $q = \frac{200 + B}{5}$  Utility: $U = \frac{200 + B}{5}$  Set it to his original 50: $\frac{200 + B}{5} = 50$  $200 + B = 250$  $B = 50$  With Rs 250: $q = 250 / 5 = 50$  $U = 50$  He’s back to his OG happiness. $B = 50$  , my G.

### Big Picture: Why This Matters for ISI MSQE

This ain’t just numbers—it’s **consumer theory**, straight up. You’re dealin’ with:

- **Utility Functions**: How a homie measures happiness.
- **Budget Constraints**: The cash limit on his grind.
- **Price Changes**: How the market flexes on his wallet.
- **Income Adjustments**: What it takes to keep his vibe steady.

For Leontief goods, it’s all about that 1:1 ratio. When prices shift, you gotta recalculate his optimal bundle and adjust his income to match utilities across scenarios. That’s the gangster way to handle **welfare economics** questions on the MSQE.

### Gangster Wrap-Up

Rahul’s story tells us: in the current hood, he’s ballin’ at utility 50 with 50 units each. New hood jacks him down to 40 unless he gets compensated. A Rs 40 pay cut at home feels the same as movin’ with no raise, and a Rs 50 bonus in the new spot keeps him at his original 50. Final answer? $A = 40$  , $B = 50$  —option (B) if they’re testin’ you with choices.

Yo, you’re ready, fam. Study this, grind those past papers, and walk into that ISI MSQE like the boss you are. Keep your utility maxed and your budget tight. Peace out! https://grok.com/chat/40c2d9ee-a690-49f7-9474-002fd2335fa7
