To determine the expected sign of the regression coefficient $\beta_0$  in the given linear regression equation, we need to analyze the predictions of the Solow growth model. The regression equation provided is:

$g_i = \alpha + \beta_0 \log y_{i,0} + \beta_1 \log n_i + \beta_2 \log s_i + \gamma X_i + \varepsilon_i$

where:

- $g_i$  is the growth rate of per capita real GDP for country $i$  ,
- $y_{i,0}$  is the initial per capita real GDP at the beginning of the period,
- $n_i$  is the population growth rate,
- $s_i$  is the savings rate,
- $X_i$  represents additional explanatory variables,
- $\varepsilon_i$  is the error term,
- and $\alpha, \beta_0, \beta_1, \beta_2, \gamma$  are the coefficients to be estimated.

The question specifically asks for the expected sign of $\beta_0$  , the coefficient on $\log y_{i,0}$  , based on the Solow growth model’s predictions.

### Understanding the Solow Growth Model

The Solow growth model is a neoclassical framework that explains long-term economic growth through capital accumulation, labor (or population) growth, and technological progress. A central prediction of the model is **conditional convergence**, which states that, all else equal, economies with lower initial levels of per capita GDP will grow faster than those with higher initial levels, as they converge toward their steady-state level of output per worker.

In the steady-state, the per capita GDP growth rate is determined by exogenous technological progress (often assumed constant across countries in the basic model). However, during the transition to the steady-state, the growth rate depends on the economy’s starting position relative to its steady-state. Countries starting with lower per capita GDP (below their steady-state) have more room to accumulate capital per worker, leading to higher growth rates, while those with higher initial GDP (closer to or above their steady-state) grow more slowly.

### Applying the Model to the Regression

In the regression equation, $g_i$  (the dependent variable) is the growth rate of per capita GDP, and $\log y_{i,0}$  (one of the independent variables) is the logarithm of the initial per capita GDP. The coefficient $\beta_0$  measures the relationship between the initial level of per capita GDP and the subsequent growth rate, holding other factors constant.

According to the Solow model’s conditional convergence hypothesis:

- A **lower** $y_{i,0}$  (initial per capita GDP) implies a higher growth rate $g_i$  , because the country is further below its steady-state and has greater potential for capital accumulation.
- A **higher** $y_{i,0}$  implies a lower growth rate $g_i$  , as the country is closer to or above its steady-state, where growth slows down.

Since $\log y_{i,0}$  is the natural logarithm of $y_{i,0}$  , and the logarithm is a monotonically increasing function, an increase in $y_{i,0}$  corresponds to an increase in $\log y_{i,0}$  . Thus, if higher initial GDP leads to lower growth, the relationship between $\log y_{i,0}$  and $g_i$  should be negative. Mathematically, this implies that $\beta_0$  , the slope coefficient on $\log y_{i,0}$  , should be **negative**.

### Role of Control Variables

The regression includes $\log n_i$  (population growth rate), $\log s_i$  (savings rate), and $X_i$  (additional explanatory variables) as controls. In the Solow model, the steady-state level of per capita GDP depends on these factors:

- A higher savings rate ( $s_i$  ) increases the steady-state per capita GDP, leading to higher transitional growth for a given initial level.
- A higher population growth rate ( $n_i$  ) decreases the steady-state per capita GDP, reducing transitional growth.
- $X_i$  might include variables like human capital or institutional quality, which also influence the steady-state.

By controlling for these determinants of the steady-state, the regression isolates the effect of the initial GDP ( $\log y_{i,0}$  ) on the growth rate. This setup aligns with testing **conditional convergence**, where the negative relationship between initial GDP and growth holds after accounting for differences in steady-state levels across countries.

### Theoretical and Empirical Support

Theoretically, the Solow model suggests that the growth rate of per capita GDP can be approximated near the steady-state as:

$g_i \approx -\lambda (\log y_{i,0} - \log y_i^*)$

where $y_i^*$  is the steady-state per capita GDP, and $\lambda > 0$  is the speed of convergence. Since $y_i^*$  is unobserved, empirical regressions proxy it with variables like $s_i$  and $n_i$  . Rewriting the equation, $\beta_0 = -\lambda$  , which is negative, confirming that higher initial GDP reduces growth.

Empirically, studies testing the Solow model often find a negative coefficient on initial GDP when appropriate controls are included, supporting the convergence hypothesis.

### Conclusion

Based on the Solow growth model’s prediction of conditional convergence, the expected sign of $\beta_0$  in the regression is **negative**. This reflects the inverse relationship between the initial level of per capita GDP ( $\log y_{i,0}$  ) and the growth rate ( $g_i$  ), after controlling for factors like savings rates, population growth, and other variables.

Thus, the expected sign of the regression coefficient $\beta_0$  is negative. https://grok.com/chat/3e4ad98e-f70e-4728-87be-35f54371cd10
