To determine the correct mean $\mu$ of the ball bearing diameters, we start by noting that the diameters follow a normal distribution with an unknown mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$ . We are given two key pieces of information about the rejection rates:

- 8% of the bearings are rejected as too small if their diameter is less than 1.8 cm. This translates to $P(X < 1.8) = 0.08$  .
- 5.5% of the bearings are rejected as too large if their diameter is greater than 2.4 cm. This means $P(X > 2.4) = 0.055$  .

Additionally, we have values of the cumulative distribution function (CDF) for a standard normal distribution:

- $F(1.4) = 0.92$
- $F(0.14) = 0.555$
- $F(-0.2) = 0.42$
- $F(-1.6) = 0.055$

Our goal is to find $\mu$ from the options: 2, 2.33, 2.08, or 2.4.

### Step 1: Standardize the Normal Distribution

Since $X$  , the diameter, follows a normal distribution $N(\mu, \sigma^2)$  , we can convert the given conditions into standard normal z-scores using the formula:

$z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}$

- For the lower limit: $P(X < 1.8) = P\left( Z < \frac{1.8 - \mu}{\sigma} \right) = 0.08$  Here, $Z$  is a standard normal variable, and $F(z)$  is its CDF, so: \[ F\\left( \\frac{1.8 - \\mu

To determine the mean diameter of ball bearings produced in a factory, we are given that the diameters follow a normal distribution with an unknown mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$ . Additionally, 8% of the bearings are rejected for being too small (diameter less than 1.8 cm), and 5.5% are rejected for being too large (diameter greater than 2.4 cm). We are also provided with specific values of the standard normal cumulative distribution function (CDF): $F(1.4) = 0.92$ , $F(0.14) = 0.555$ , $F(-0.2) = 0.42$ , and $F(-1.6) = 0.055$ . Our task is to find $\mu$ , with possible answer choices being 2, 2.33, 2.08, or 2.4 cm.

### Step 1: Define the Problem Using the Normal Distribution

Since the diameters $X$ are normally distributed with mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$ , we can use the properties of the normal distribution to relate the rejection rates to $\mu$ and $\sigma$ . The standard normal variable $Z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma}$ follows a standard normal distribution, where $F(z) = P(Z < z)$ is the CDF.

- **Lower rejection limit**: 8% of bearings have a diameter less than 1.8 cm, so:
	$$
	P(X < 1.8) = 0.08
	$$
	 Converting to the standard normal:
	$$
	P\left(Z < \frac{1.8 - \mu}{\sigma}\right) = 0.08
	$$
	 Let $z_1 = \frac{1.8 - \mu}{\sigma}$ , where $F(z_1) = 0.08$ .
- **Upper rejection limit**: 5.5% of bearings have a diameter greater than 2.4 cm, so:
	$$
	P(X > 2.4) = 0.055
	$$
	 Since $P(X > 2.4) = 1 - P(X < 2.4)$ , we have:
	$$
	1 - P(X < 2.4) = 0.055 \implies P(X < 2.4) = 1 - 0.055 = 0.945
	$$
	 Converting to the standard normal:
	$$
	P\left(Z < \frac{2.4 - \mu}{\sigma}\right) = 0.945
	$$
	 Let $z_2 = \frac{2.4 - \mu}{\sigma}$ , where $F(z_2) = 0.945$ .

We need to find $z_1$ and $z_2$ using the given CDF values, then solve for $\mu$ and $\sigma$ .

---

### Step 2: Determine the Z-Scores Using Provided CDF Values

The problem provides specific CDF values for the standard normal distribution:

- $F(1.4) = 0.92$
- $F(0.14) = 0.555$
- $F(-0.2) = 0.42$
- $F(-1.6) = 0.055$

Additionally, since the standard normal distribution is symmetric about zero, $F(-z) = 1 - F(z)$ , we can compute:

- $F(-1.4) = 1 - F(1.4) = 1 - 0.92 = 0.08$
- $F(1.6) = 1 - F(-1.6) = 1 - 0.055 = 0.945$
- **Lower tail**: We need $F(z_1) = 0.08$ . From the computed value:
	$$
	F(-1.4) = 0.08
	$$
	 So, $z_1 = -1.4$ . Thus:
	$$
	\frac{1.8 - \mu}{\sigma} = -1.4 \quad (1)
	$$
- **Upper tail**: We need $F(z_2) = 0.945$ . From the computed value:
	$$
	F(1.6) = 0.945
	$$
	 So, $z_2 = 1.6$ . Thus:
	$$
	\frac{2.4 - \mu}{\sigma} = 1.6 \quad (2)
	$$

These $z$ -scores align perfectly with the rejection probabilities given in the problem, using the provided CDF values and their symmetric properties.

---

### Step 3: Solve the System of Equations

We now have two equations:

1. $\frac{1.8 - \mu}{\sigma} = -1.4$
2. $\frac{2.4 - \mu}{\sigma} = 1.6$

Rewrite them:

- Equation (1): $1.8 - \mu = -1.4\sigma$
- Equation (2): $2.4 - \mu = 1.6\sigma$

Subtract Equation (1) from Equation (2) to eliminate $\mu$ :

$$
(2.4 - \mu) - (1.8 - \mu) = 1.6\sigma - (-1.4\sigma)
$$
 
$$
2.4 - 1.8 = 1.6\sigma + 1.4\sigma
$$
 
$$
0.6 = 3.0\sigma
$$
 
$$
\sigma = \frac{0.6}{3.0} = 0.2
$$

Substitute $\sigma = 0.2$ into Equation (1):

$$
1.8 - \mu = -1.4 \times 0.2
$$
 
$$
1.8 - \mu = -0.28
$$
 
$$
\mu = 1.8 + 0.28 = 2.08
$$

Check with Equation (2):

$$
2.4 - \mu = 1.6 \times 0.2
$$
 
$$
2.4 - \mu = 0.32
$$
 
$$
\mu = 2.4 - 0.32 = 2.08
$$

The calculations are consistent, so $\mu = 2.08$ cm and $\sigma = 0.2$ cm.

---

### Step 4: Verify the Solution

Let’s confirm the rejection probabilities:

- **Lower tail**: $P(X < 1.8) = P\left(Z < \frac{1.8 - 2.08}{0.2}\right) = P(Z < -1.4)$ 
	$$
	F(-1.4) = 0.08
	$$
	 This matches the given 8%.
- **Upper tail**: $P(X > 2.4) = P\left(Z > \frac{2.4 - 2.08}{0.2}\right) = P(Z > 1.6)$ 
	$$
	P(Z > 1.6) = 1 - F(1.6) = 1 - 0.945 = 0.055
	$$
	 This matches the given 5.5%.

The solution satisfies both conditions using the problem’s CDF values.

### Step 5: Compare with Options

The possible answers are 2, 2.33, 2.08, and 2.4 cm. Our calculated mean is 2.08 cm, which is among the options, reinforcing confidence in the solution.

---

### Final Answer

The mean diameter of the ball bearings is 2.08 cm.

Now explain the related topics in deep, each key term in expansive detail building intuition and understanding to face such questions and be prepared. ( gangster style hardcore)

Alright, let’s dive into this hardcore, gangster-style breakdown of the key concepts you need to master to dominate questions like this. We’re talking normal distribution, standard deviation, z-scores, and cumulative distribution functions (CDF)—the heavy hitters of probability and stats. I’m gonna lay it all out, raw and unfiltered, with deep detail to build your intuition and prep you to crush any problem that comes your way. No fluff, just the real shit.

### 1\. Normal Distribution: The Boss of Probability

- **What It Is**: Picture a bell-shaped curve, smooth and symmetric, sittin’ pretty with its peak smack in the middle. That’s the normal distribution, the OG of probability distributions. It’s how data rolls when shit’s random but clusters around an average—like the diameters of ball bearings in a factory. Most are close to the mean, with fewer stragglers way out on the edges.
- **The Math**: It’s governed by two players:
	- **Mean ( $\mu$ )**: The center of the action. Shift it left or right, and the whole curve slides with it. It’s the target size you’re aiming for.
	- **Standard Deviation ( $\sigma$ )**: The spread. Small $\sigma$ , and the curve’s tight, like a crew that sticks close. Big $\sigma$ , and it’s wide open, data sprawlin’ everywhere.
- **The Formula**: The probability density function (PDF) is:
	$$
	f(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\frac{(x - \mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}
	$$
	 Don’t trip on the details—just know it’s exponential decay from the mean, controlled by $\sigma$ .
- **Why It Rules**: In real life, tons of shit—height, test scores, manufacturing tolerances—follows this pattern. It’s universal because of the Central Limit Theorem (more on that later if you’re ready to level up).
- **Intuition**: Imagine tossing a million ball bearings on a table. Most land near 2 cm (the mean), with fewer at 1.5 cm or 2.5 cm. That’s the normal distribution flexin’ its muscle.

---

### 2\. Standard Deviation: The Spread King

- **What It Is**: Standard deviation ( $\sigma$ ) measures how much your data’s wildin’ out from the mean. It’s the ruler of variation—how tight or loose your crew is.
- **Deep Dive**:
	- **Small $\sigma$**: Data’s huddled close to $\mu$ . Think ball bearings all damn near 2 cm—high precision manufacturing.
	- **Big $\sigma$**: Data’s all over the place. Bearings ranging from 1 cm to 3 cm—sloppy as hell.
- **The 68-95-99.7 Rule**: In a normal distribution:
	- 68% of the data is within 1 $\sigma$ of the mean.
	- 95% within 2 $\sigma$ .
	- 99.7% within 3 $\sigma$ .
	- Example: If $\mu = 2$ cm and $\sigma = 0.2$ cm, 95% of bearings are between 1.6 cm and 2.4 cm.
- **Why It’s Gangster**: It tells you how consistent your process is. In manufacturing, a tight $\sigma$ means quality; a fat one means chaos.
- **Intuition**: Think of $\sigma$ as the radius of your crew’s turf. Small radius, everyone’s in sight. Big radius, they’re scattered across the block.

---

### 3\. Z-Scores: The Street Translator

- **What It Is**: A z-score is how you take any normal distribution and flip it into the standard normal distribution—mean 0, standard deviation 1. It’s your ticket to the big leagues.
- **The Formula**:
	$$
	z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}
	$$
	- $x$ : The value you’re checking (like a 1.8 cm bearing).
	- $\mu$ : The mean.
	- $\sigma$ : The standard deviation.
- **What It Means**:
	- $z = 1$ : 1 standard deviation above the mean.
	- $z = -1.4$ : 1.4 standard deviations below the mean.
	- $z = 0$ : Dead on the mean.
- **Why It’s Dope**: It standardizes everything. A bearing of 1.8 cm with $\mu = 2$ and $\sigma = 0.2$ has $z = (1.8 - 2) / 0.2 = -1$ . Same $z$ applies to any normal distribution with the same relative distance.
- **Intuition**: Z-scores are like GPS coordinates. They tell you exactly where you’re at relative to home base (the mean), no matter the scale of the map ( $\sigma$ ).

---

### 4\. Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF): The Probability Plug

- **What It Is**: The CDF, $F(z)$ , tells you the probability that a standard normal variable $Z$ is less than or equal to some z-score:
	$$
	F(z) = P(Z \leq z)
	$$
- **The Vibe**:
	- Ranges from 0 to 1.
	- $z = 0$ , $F(0) = 0.5$ —half the data’s below the mean.
	- $z$ goes positive, $F(z) > 0.5$ ; goes negative, $F(z) < 0.5$ .
	- **Symmetry**: $F(-z) = 1 - F(z)$ . If $F(1.6) = 0.945$ , then $F(-1.6) = 0.055$ .
- **How You Use It**: You got tables or values—like $F(1.4) = 0.92$ —to look up probabilities. No integration needed; the work’s done for you.
- **Why It’s Key**: In problems with rejection rates (e.g., 8% of bearings < 1.8 cm), you use the CDF to link z-scores to probabilities and solve for $\mu$ and $\sigma$ .
- **Intuition**: Think of the CDF as a meter filling up. At $z = -\infty$ , it’s empty (0). At $z = \infty$ , it’s full (1). Every $z$ in between is a checkpoint on the probability scale.

### 5\. Putting It All Together: Solving Problems Like a G

- **The Setup**: Say you’re given:
	- 8% of bearings are too small (< 1.8 cm): $P(X < 1.8) = 0.08$ .
	- 5.5% are too big (> 2.4 cm): $P(X > 2.4) = 0.055$ .
	- CDF values: $F(-1.4) = 0.08$ , $F(1.6) = 0.945$ .
- **Step 1: Translate to Z-Scores**:
	- Lower tail: $P(X < 1.8) = F\left(\frac{1.8 - \mu}{\sigma}\right) = 0.08$ . Since $F(-1.4) = 0.08$ , then $\frac{1.8 - \mu}{\sigma} = -1.4$ .
	- Upper tail: $P(X < 2.4) = 1 - 0.055 = 0.945$ . Since $F(1.6) = 0.945$ , then $\frac{2.4 - \mu}{\sigma} = 1.6$ .
- **Step 2: Build the Equations**:
	1. $1.8 - \mu = -1.4\sigma$
	2. $2.4 - \mu = 1.6\sigma$
- **Step 3: Solve That Shit**:
	- Subtract: $(2.4 - \mu) - (1.8 - \mu) = 1.6\sigma - (-1.4\sigma) \implies 0.6 = 3.0\sigma \implies \sigma = 0.2$ .
	- Plug in: $1.8 - \mu = -1.4 \times 0.2 = -0.28 \implies \mu = 1.8 + 0.28 = 2.08$ .
- **Step 4: Verify**:
	- $z = (1.8 - 2.08) / 0.2 = -1.4$ , $F(-1.4) = 0.08$ . Check.
	- $z = (2.4 - 2.08) / 0.2 = 1.6$ , $1 - F(1.6) = 0.055$ . Check.
- **Intuition**: You’re reverse-engineering the curve to fit the rejection rates. It’s like tuning a gun to hit the target dead-on.

### 6\. Building Intuition: How to Own These Problems

- **Normal Distribution**: Visualize the bell curve. Move $\mu$ , it slides; tweak $\sigma$ , it stretches or shrinks.
- **Standard Deviation**: Feel the spread. Tight $\sigma$ = precision; loose $\sigma$ = mess.
- **Z-Scores**: Practice converting values to z-scores. It’s your universal translator.
- **CDF**: Get comfy with tables or given values. Know that $F(z)$ is your probability lifeline.
- **Equations**: When you see percentages (like 8% or 5.5%), turn ’em into CDF equations and solve. It’s algebra with a purpose.
- **Verification**: Always double-check. If the numbers don’t vibe, you fucked up somewhere.
