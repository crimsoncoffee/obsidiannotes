Below, I provide complete and self-contained answers to Questions 9 and 10 based on the economic model described in the query. The model is a demand-determined economy where output (income) equals aggregate demand, income is distributed between workers and capitalists, and investment is autonomous. Let's dive into each question systematically.

---

### Question 9: Suppose savings propensities of both the workers and capitalists increase. Then, in the new equilibrium, what happens to aggregate savings and income?

In this model, total income $Y$  is determined by aggregate demand, which consists of consumption and investment. Investment is fixed at $\bar{I}$  . Workers receive a proportion $\lambda$  of income (i.e., $\lambda Y$  ), and capitalists receive the remainder $(1 - \lambda) Y$  . Workers save a fraction $s_w$  of their income and consume the rest, so their consumption is $(1 - s_w) \lambda Y$  . Capitalists save a fraction $s_c$  of their income and consume $(1 - s_c) (1 - \lambda) Y$  . We are given that $s_w > s_c$  , and the question states that both $s_w$  and $s_c$  increase.

#### Step 1: Equilibrium Income

Aggregate demand (AD) is the sum of total consumption and investment:

- Total consumption $C = (1 - s_w) \lambda Y + (1 - s_c) (1 - \lambda) Y$
- Investment = $\bar{I}$

Thus, $AD = C + \bar{I} = [(1 - s_w) \lambda + (1 - s_c) (1 - \lambda)] Y + \bar{I}$  .

In equilibrium, income equals aggregate demand: $Y = AD$  . So: $Y = [(1 - s_w) \lambda + (1 - s_c) (1 - \lambda)] Y + \bar{I}$

Rearrange: $Y - [(1 - s_w) \lambda + (1 - s_c) (1 - \lambda)] Y = \bar{I}$  $Y [1 - (1 - s_w) \lambda - (1 - s_c) (1 - \lambda)] = \bar{I}$

Simplify the expression inside the brackets: $1 - (1 - s_w) \lambda - (1 - s_c) (1 - \lambda) = 1 - (\lambda - s_w \lambda + 1 - \lambda - s_c (1 - \lambda))$  $= 1 - 1 + s_w \lambda + s_c (1 - \lambda) = s_w \lambda + s_c (1 - \lambda)$

Thus: $Y [s_w \lambda + s_c (1 - \lambda)] = \bar{I}$  $Y = \frac{\bar{I}}{s_w \lambda + s_c (1 - \lambda)}$

This is the equilibrium income.

#### Step 2: Aggregate Savings

Aggregate savings $S$  is the sum of savings by workers and capitalists:

- Workers' savings = $s_w (\lambda Y)$
- Capitalists' savings = $s_c [(1 - \lambda) Y]$
- Total savings $S = s_w \lambda Y + s_c (1 - \lambda) Y = [s_w \lambda + s_c (1 - \lambda)] Y$

Substitute $Y = \frac{\bar{I}}{s_w \lambda + s_c (1 - \lambda)}$  : $S = [s_w \lambda + s_c (1 - \lambda)] \cdot \frac{\bar{I}}{s_w \lambda + s_c (1 - \lambda)} = \bar{I}$

Alternatively, since $Y = C + \bar{I}$  and $S = Y - C$  , we have $S = (C + \bar{I}) - C = \bar{I}$  . In equilibrium, savings equal investment, which is fixed at $\bar{I}$  .

#### Step 3: Effect of Increasing sw s\_w and sc s\_c

- **Income ( $Y$  )**: In the expression $Y = \frac{\bar{I}}{s_w \lambda + s_c (1 - \lambda)}$  , the denominator $s_w \lambda + s_c (1 - \lambda)$  is the average savings rate, weighted by income shares. Since $\lambda$  and $(1 - \lambda)$  are positive and fixed, if $s_w$  and $s_c$  increase, the denominator increases. With $\bar{I}$  constant, $Y$  decreases.
- **Savings ( $S$  )**: From above, $S = \bar{I}$  , which is autonomous and does not change when $s_w$  or $s_c$  increases.

Thus, when the savings propensities of both workers and capitalists increase, equilibrium income decreases due to reduced consumption (a higher savings rate lowers the multiplier), but aggregate savings remains unchanged because it equals the fixed investment $\bar{I}$  .

#### Answer to Question 9

The correct option is (c): **aggregate savings remains unchanged and income decreases**.

---

### Question 10: Suppose savings propensities remain the same but the share of total income distributed to the workers increases. Then, in the new equilibrium, what happens to aggregate savings and income?

Here, $s_w$  and $s_c$  are fixed (with $s_w > s_c$  ), but $\lambda$  (the workers' share of income) increases, so $(1 - \lambda)$  decreases.

#### Step 1: Equilibrium Income

Using the same equilibrium condition from Question 9: $Y = \frac{\bar{I}}{s_w \lambda + s_c (1 - \lambda)}$

#### Step 2: Aggregate Savings

As derived previously: $S = [s_w \lambda + s_c (1 - \lambda)] Y = \bar{I}$

#### Step 3: Effect of Increasing λ \\lambda

- **Income ( $Y$  )**: Examine the denominator $s_w \lambda + s_c (1 - \lambda)$  . As $\lambda$  increases, we assess its impact:
	- Take the derivative with respect to $\lambda$  : $\frac{d}{d\lambda} [s_w \lambda + s_c (1 - \lambda)] = s_w - s_c$
	- Since $s_w > s_c$  , $s_w - s_c > 0$  , so the denominator increases as $\lambda$  increases.
	- With $\bar{I}$  fixed, if the denominator grows, $Y$  decreases.
	Alternatively, since workers save more than capitalists ( $s_w > s_c$  ), shifting income toward workers (higher $\lambda$  ) raises the average savings rate, reducing consumption and thus lowering equilibrium income via a smaller multiplier.
- **Savings ( $S$  )**: $S = \bar{I}$  , which remains constant regardless of changes in $\lambda$  , as investment is autonomous.

Thus, when the share of income to workers increases, equilibrium income decreases because the higher savings propensity of workers reduces aggregate consumption, but aggregate savings remains equal to the fixed investment $\bar{I}$  .

#### Answer to Question 10

The correct option is (c): **aggregate savings remains unchanged and income decreases**.

---

### Summary

- **Question 9**: Increasing $s_w$  and $s_c$  leads to higher savings propensities, reducing consumption and thus income, while savings equals $\bar{I}$  (unchanged). Answer: (c).
- **Question 10**: Increasing $\lambda$  shifts income to workers who save more, raising the average savings rate, reducing income, while savings remains $\bar{I}$  (unchanged). Answer: (c).

For both questions, the result is: **aggregate savings remains unchanged and income decreases**, corresponding to option (c).

## Understanding the Demand-Determined Economy

In this model, we explore a **demand-determined economy**, a cornerstone of Keynesian economics. Here, the level of output (or income) in the economy is driven by aggregate demand rather than supply constraints. Unlike classical models that assume full employment, this model allows for equilibrium at less than full employment if aggregate demand is insufficient.

### Key Assumptions

1. **Income Equals Output:**
	- Total income $Y$  in the economy equals the total output produced. In a closed economy without government, this is a standard national income accounting identity.
2. **Equilibrium Condition:**
	- The economy is in equilibrium when total income equals aggregate demand ( $AD$  ):
		$$
		Y = AD
		$$
3. **Income Distribution:**
	- Income is split between two groups: **workers** and **capitalists**.
	- Workers receive a fixed proportion $\lambda$  of total income, where $0 < \lambda < 1$  :
		- Workers’ income = $\lambda Y$
	- Capitalists receive the remaining share:
		- Capitalists’ income = $(1 - \lambda) Y$
4. **Consumption and Savings Behavior:**
	- **Workers:**
		- Save a fraction $s_w$  of their income, where $0 \leq s_w < 1$  .
		- Consume the rest: Marginal propensity to consume (MPC) = $1 - s_w$  .
		- Workers’ consumption: $C_w = (1 - s_w) \lambda Y$
		- Workers’ savings: $S_w = s_w \lambda Y$
	- **Capitalists:**
		- Save a fraction $s_c$  of their income, where $0 \leq s_c < 1$  .
		- Consume the rest: MPC = $1 - s_c$  .
		- Capitalists’ consumption: $C_c = (1 - s_c) (1 - \lambda) Y$
		- Capitalists’ savings: $S_c = s_c (1 - \lambda) Y$
	- A key condition: **$s_w > s_c$** , meaning workers have a higher propensity to save than capitalists (though in some variations, this could differ).
5. **Investment:**
	- Investment ( $I$  ) is **autonomous**, fixed at $\bar{I}$  , and does not depend on income, interest rates, or other variables in this simple model.
6. **Aggregate Demand:**
	- Aggregate demand is the sum of consumption by both groups plus investment:
		$$
		AD = C_w + C_c + \bar{I}
		$$
		 Substituting the consumption functions:
		$$
		AD = (1 - s_w) \lambda Y + (1 - s_c) (1 - \lambda) Y + \bar{I}
		$$

---

## Deriving Equilibrium Income

To find the equilibrium income, set $Y = AD$  and solve for $Y$  :

$$
Y = (1 - s_w) \lambda Y + (1 - s_c) (1 - \lambda) Y + \bar{I}
$$

### Step-by-Step Derivation

1. **Move all terms with $Y$  to one side:**
	$$
	Y - (1 - s_w) \lambda Y - (1 - s_c) (1 - \lambda) Y = \bar{I}
	$$
2. **Factor out $Y$  :**
	$$
	Y \left[ 1 - (1 - s_w) \lambda - (1 - s_c) (1 - \lambda) \right] = \bar{I}
	$$
3. **Simplify the expression inside the brackets:**
	- Expand the terms:
		$$
		(1 - s_w) \lambda = \lambda - s_w \lambda
		$$
		 
		$$
		(1 - s_c) (1 - \lambda) = 1 - \lambda - s_c (1 - \lambda)
		$$
	- Substitute and simplify:
		$$
		1 - (1 - s_w) \lambda - (1 - s_c) (1 - \lambda) = 1 - (\lambda - s_w \lambda) - (1 - \lambda - s_c (1 - \lambda))
		$$
		 
		$$
		= 1 - \lambda + s_w \lambda - 1 + \lambda + s_c (1 - \lambda)
		$$
		 
		$$
		= (1 - 1) + (-\lambda + \lambda) + s_w \lambda + s_c (1 - \lambda)
		$$
		 
		$$
		= s_w \lambda + s_c (1 - \lambda)
		$$
4. **Equilibrium equation:**
	$$
	Y \left[ s_w \lambda + s_c (1 - \lambda) \right] = \bar{I}
	$$
5. **Solve for $Y$  :**
	$$
	Y = \frac{\bar{I}}{s_w \lambda + s_c (1 - \lambda)}
	$$

This is the **equilibrium income**. The denominator $s_w \lambda + s_c (1 - \lambda)$  represents the weighted average savings rate, with weights $\lambda$  (workers’ share) and $1 - \lambda$  (capitalists’ share).

---

## The Multiplier

In Keynesian economics, the multiplier measures how much equilibrium income changes due to a change in autonomous spending (here, $\bar{I}$  ). The multiplier is the reciprocal of the marginal propensity to save (MPS). In this model:

- Effective MPS = $s_w \lambda + s_c (1 - \lambda)$
- Multiplier = $\frac{1}{s_w \lambda + s_c (1 - \lambda)}$

If autonomous investment increases by $\Delta \bar{I}$  , the change in income is:

$$
\Delta Y = \frac{\Delta \bar{I}}{s_w \lambda + s_c (1 - \lambda)}
$$

A higher savings rate (larger denominator) reduces the multiplier, meaning a smaller increase in income for the same increase in investment.

---

## Aggregate Savings in Equilibrium

Total savings ( $S$  ) is the sum of savings by workers and capitalists:

$$
S = S_w + S_c = s_w \lambda Y + s_c (1 - \lambda) Y
$$
 
$$
S = [s_w \lambda + s_c (1 - \lambda)] Y
$$

Substitute the equilibrium income:

$$
S = [s_w \lambda + s_c (1 - \lambda)] \cdot \frac{\bar{I}}{s_w \lambda + s_c (1 - \lambda)}
$$
 
$$
S = \bar{I}
$$

Alternatively, in equilibrium:

- $Y = C + \bar{I}$  (where $C = C_w + C_c$  )
- Savings $S = Y - C = (C + \bar{I}) - C = \bar{I}$

This confirms the **savings-investment equality**: in equilibrium, total savings equals autonomous investment. This is a fundamental Keynesian result in a closed economy without government.

---

## Analyzing Changes in Parameters

Let’s explore how changes in savings propensities ( $s_w$  , $s_c$  ) and income distribution ( $\lambda$  ) affect equilibrium income and savings, assuming $\bar{I}$  is constant.

### Scenario 1: Increase in Savings Propensities (sw s\_w and sc s\_c )

- **Effect on Income ( $Y$  ):**
	- From $Y = \frac{\bar{I}}{s_w \lambda + s_c (1 - \lambda)}$  :
		- If $s_w$  increases, $s_w \lambda$  increases (since $\lambda > 0$  ).
		- If $s_c$  increases, $s_c (1 - \lambda)$  increases (since $1 - \lambda > 0$  ).
		- The denominator rises, reducing $Y$  (as $\bar{I}$  is fixed).
	- **Intuition:** Higher savings propensities mean lower consumption, reducing aggregate demand and thus equilibrium income.
- **Effect on Savings ( $S$  ):**
	- $S = \bar{I}$  , which remains unchanged.
	- **Paradox of Thrift:** Individuals save more of their income, but total savings doesn’t increase because income falls, offsetting the higher savings rates.

**Conclusion:** Income decreases, aggregate savings stays the same.

### Scenario 2: Increase in Workers’ Share (λ \\lambda ), with sw>sc s\_w > s\_c

- **Effect on Income ( $Y$  ):**
	- Denominator: $s_w \lambda + s_c (1 - \lambda)$
	- Check how it changes with $\lambda$  :
		$$
		\frac{d}{d\lambda} [s_w \lambda + s_c (1 - \lambda)] = s_w - s_c
		$$
		- Since $s_w > s_c$  , $s_w - s_c > 0$  , so the denominator increases as $\lambda$  rises.
		- With $\bar{I}$  constant, $Y$  decreases.
	- **Intuition:** Workers save more than capitalists. Shifting income to workers increases the average savings rate, reducing consumption and aggregate demand.
- **Effect on Savings ( $S$  ):**
	- $S = \bar{I}$  , unchanged.
	- The composition shifts (more savings from workers, less from capitalists), but total savings equals $\bar{I}$  .

**Conclusion:** Income decreases, aggregate savings remains unchanged.

---

## Key Concepts and Insights

1. **Equilibrium Income:**
	- Determined by balancing aggregate demand with output.
	- Depends on consumption (via savings propensities and income shares) and autonomous investment.
2. **Savings-Investment Equality:**
	- In equilibrium, $S = \bar{I}$  . Changes in behavior adjust income to maintain this balance.
3. **Paradox of Thrift:**
	- Higher savings propensities reduce income without increasing total savings, as the economy contracts.
4. **Income Distribution:**
	- When savings propensities differ, redistributing income affects the average savings rate and thus income.
5. **Multiplier:**
	- Smaller when the average savings rate is higher, amplifying or dampening the effect of autonomous spending changes.

---

## Tackling Variations for ISI MSQE

The ISI MSQE exam may present variations. Here’s how to approach them:

1. **Different Savings Propensities:**
	- If $s_c > s_w$  , increasing $\lambda$  reduces the average savings rate, increasing income.
2. **Fiscal Policy:**
	- Add government spending ( $G$  ) to $AD = C_w + C_c + \bar{I} + G$  , or taxes reducing disposable income. Solve for new equilibrium.
3. **Endogenous Investment:**
	- If $I = I(Y)$  (e.g., $I = a + bY$  ), the model becomes dynamic, requiring a new equilibrium condition.
4. **Open Economy:**
	- Include exports and imports in $AD$  . Net exports may depend on income, altering the multiplier.
5. **Multiple Sectors:**
	- Different production sectors or classes may complicate consumption and savings functions.

### General Strategy:

- Write the equilibrium condition: $Y = AD$  .
- Define $AD$  based on the model’s components.
- Solve for $Y$  and $S$  .
- Analyze parameter changes using derivatives or intuition.

---

## Conclusion

This demand-determined model illustrates how income adjusts to equate aggregate demand with output. Equilibrium income is $Y = \frac{\bar{I}}{s_w \lambda + s_c (1 - \lambda)}$  , and savings equals $\bar{I}$  . Changes increasing the savings rate (higher $s_w$  , $s_c$  , or $\lambda$  when $s_w > s_c$  ) reduce income but leave savings unchanged due to the savings-investment equality. Mastering these derivations and concepts will prepare you for any related question in the ISI MSQE exam.

Completed 2m 5s ThinkingUnderstanding the requestAnalyzing economic modelExploring savings impactExplaining to the userThinkingUnderstanding the request

- The request is for a comprehensive explanation in casual, street-style language, clear and detailed.

- It seems the user wants me to explain an economic theory, likely from the previous conversation, in a way that's easy to get, like chatting with a homie.

- I'm considering if the user needs a rephrased version of something already explained or if there's a specific gap to fill.

- Since there are image attachments mentioned, I'm thinking they might hold key info for the explanation.

- I'm wondering if the images contain text of Questions 9 and 10 from before, given the AI already answered them.

- Hmm, the user’s asking for an explanation, so maybe they want me to break down the theory or answers in a chill, homie way.

- The attachment details an economic model for Questions 9 and 10, where output is demand-driven and income splits between workers and capitalists.

- Each group saves a portion of their income, with workers saving more than capitalists, and investment is fixed at a set level.

Analyzing economic model

- Total income Y equals aggregate demand AD, which includes consumption by workers and capitalists, plus fixed investment.

- Workers get λY, save s\_w of it, so they consume (1 - s\_w) \* λY; capitalists get (1 - λ)Y, save s\_c, and consume the rest.

- I'm working through the equation Y = (1 - s\_w) λ Y + (1 - s\_c) (1 - λ) Y + Ī to find equilibrium income.

- Let's check how changes in savings rates affect this, given the user’s likely goal is to understand the theory behind the answers.

- I found the equilibrium income is Y = Ī / \[ s\_w λ + s\_c (1 - λ) \], which makes sense given the model.

Exploring savings impact

- Total savings S equal investment Ī in equilibrium, which is a standard result in these models.

- If both s\_w and s\_c increase, S stays at Ī since it's tied to fixed investment.

- Now, I'm thinking about how increasing λ, the workers' share, affects income and savings, given s\_w > s\_c.

- When λ goes up, the denominator in the income formula increases, so Y drops, but S still equals Ī.

Explaining to the user

- Imagine an economy where total income depends on spending, like how much everyone's buying.

- Workers and capitalists get shares of the income, save some, and spend the rest, with workers saving more.

- If people save more, they spend less, so consumption drops. That means firms produce less, and income falls.

- But here's the twist: even if everyone saves more, total savings don't rise. It's the paradox of thrift at work.

- If workers get a bigger share, they save more, pulling income down while savings stay the same.

- There's also fixed investment, like building factories, which doesn't change and ties savings to a set level.

- If folks spend less, businesses cut back, and the economy shrinks, but total savings still match that fixed investment.

- I'm considering how to frame this in a way that feels relatable, maybe using everyday examples like saving for a rainy day versus spending on fun stuff.

- Now, I'm looking at how this ties to the multiplier effect, where spending less can shrink the economy further.

- The multiplier shows how initial spending changes ripple through, and here, less spending means a smaller economy for the same fixed investment.

- Workers have a lower marginal propensity to consume than capitalists, since they save more.

- Hey, let's break it down like this: if everyone tries to save more, it's like putting money aside for a rainy day, but then businesses sell less, and the economy takes a hit.

- This ties back to the user's goal of understanding why income drops but savings don't change, which is key to grasping the theory.

- I'm thinking about explaining how we derive Y = Ī / \[s\_w λ + s\_c (1 - λ)\], to show the math behind it.

- Capitalists get (1 - λ)Y, save s\_c, so they spend (1 - s\_c) (1 - λ)Y, confirming the model setup.

- The denominator s\_w λ + s\_c (1 - λ) acts like the economy's average savings rate, affecting how income adjusts to keep savings equal to Ī.

- I'm exploring how the multiplier concept fits, with effective MPC being MPC\_w \* λ + MPC\_c \* (1 - λ), where MPC\_w = 1 - s\_w and MPC\_c = 1 - s\_c.

- Effective MPC decreases if s\_w or s\_c increases, since MPC = 1 - s, impacting how income adjusts.

- Testing with numbers, if s\_w goes from 0.2 to 0.25 and s\_c from 0.1 to 0.15, Y drops from about 588 to 455, while S stays at 100.

- Numerical examples show that increasing λ, like from 0.7 to 0.8, also drops Y from 588 to 556, with S still at 100.

- If either group decides to save more, or if we give more income to the workers who save more, it leads to less spending overall.

- Less spending means less production and thus lower total income, but the total amount saved in the economy doesn't change because it's equal to the fixed investment.

### Key Points

- It seems likely that in this economic model, when savings rates increase or income shifts to higher savers, total income decreases, but total savings stay the same, equaling fixed investment.
- Research suggests the economy adjusts by reducing income to match lower spending, maintaining savings-investment balance.
- An unexpected detail is the "paradox of thrift," where trying to save more can shrink the economy, keeping total savings unchanged.

### Explanation

#### Overview

Hey homie, we're diving into this economic model where the total money made, or income, depends on how much people spend. It's all about demand driving the economy, with workers and capitalists splitting the income, each saving and spending differently, and there's some fixed investment too.

#### How It Works

Imagine the economy like a big pie. The pie's size, or total income Y, equals what everyone spends, called aggregate demand AD. AD includes what workers spend, what capitalists spend, and some fixed investment, like building factories, which doesn't change.

- Workers get a share λ of the pie, so λY, and save a fraction s\_w, spending the rest (1 - s\_w) λY.
- Capitalists get (1 - λ)Y, save s\_c, and spend (1 - s\_c) (1 - λ)Y.
- Importantly, workers save more than capitalists, so s\_w > s\_c.

In equilibrium, Y = AD, so we solve Y = (1 - s\_w) λY + (1 - s\_c) (1 - λ)Y + Ī, where Ī is fixed investment. This boils down to Y = Ī / \[s\_w λ + s\_c (1 - λ)\], like the denominator is the average savings rate.

Total savings S = s\_w λY + s\_c (1 - λ)Y, and in equilibrium, S = Ī, always, because savings must equal investment.

#### What Happens When Things Change

- **If both save more (s\_w and s\_c increase):** They spend less, so AD drops, and Y decreases to match, since Y = Ī / \[bigger denominator\]. But S stays Ī, 'cause the economy shrinks, it's the paradox of thrift—trying to save more doesn't increase total savings, it just makes the pie smaller.
- **If workers get more share (λ increases, and s\_w > s\_c):** More income goes to workers who save more, so overall savings rate goes up, AD drops, Y decreases, but S still = Ī, 'cause the economy adjusts income down.

So, in both cases, income goes down, savings stay the same.

### Survey Note: Detailed Explanation of the Economic Model

This section provides a comprehensive breakdown of the demand-determined economic model, focusing on how equilibrium income and aggregate savings are determined, and analyzing the effects of changes in savings propensities and income distribution. The explanation is tailored for clarity, mimicking a professional article, and includes all details from the analysis, with numerical examples for illustration.

#### Introduction to the Model

In this economic framework, the total output, or income (Y), is driven by aggregate demand (AD), a key concept in Keynesian economics. This means the economy's income isn't limited by supply but by how much people are willing to spend. The model divides income between two groups: workers and capitalists, with specific saving and spending behaviors, and includes a fixed, autonomous investment component.

#### Key Components and Assumptions

- **Income Distribution:** Workers receive a proportion λ of total income (λY), where 0 < λ < 1, and capitalists get the rest, (1 - λ)Y. For example, if λ = 0.7, workers get 70%, capitalists 30%.
- **Saving and Spending Behavior:**
	- Workers save a fraction s\_w of their income, so their marginal propensity to consume (MPC) is 1 - s\_w. They spend (1 - s\_w) λY.
	- Capitalists save s\_c, with MPC = 1 - s\_c, spending (1 - s\_c) (1 - λ)Y.
	- A critical assumption is s\_w > s\_c, meaning workers save a higher fraction of their income than capitalists, which is unusual but given in this model.
- **Investment:** Investment (Ī) is autonomously given, fixed at a constant level, like 100 units, not depending on income or other variables.
- **Equilibrium Condition:** The economy is in equilibrium when Y = AD, where AD = total consumption (workers' + capitalists') + Ī.

#### Deriving Equilibrium Income

To find Y, set Y = AD:

$$
Y = (1 - s_w) \lambda Y + (1 - s_c) (1 - \lambda) Y + \bar{I}
$$

Rearrange to solve for Y:

$$
Y - [(1 - s_w) \lambda + (1 - s_c) (1 - \lambda)] Y = \bar{I}
$$

Factor out Y:

$$
Y [1 - (1 - s_w) \lambda - (1 - s_c) (1 - \lambda)] = \bar{I}
$$

Simplify the bracketed term:

$$
(1 - s_w) \lambda = \lambda - s_w \lambda, \quad (1 - s_c) (1 - \lambda) = 1 - \lambda - s_c (1 - \lambda)
$$

Combine:

$$
1 - (\lambda - s_w \lambda) - (1 - \lambda - s_c (1 - \lambda)) = 1 - \lambda + s_w \lambda - 1 + \lambda + s_c (1 - \lambda) = s_w \lambda + s_c (1 - \lambda)
$$

So:

$$
Y [s_w \lambda + s_c (1 - \lambda)] = \bar{I}
$$

Thus, equilibrium income is:

$$
Y = \frac{\bar{I}}{s_w \lambda + s_c (1 - \lambda)}
$$

This denominator, s\_w λ + s\_c (1 - λ), is the weighted average savings rate, with weights λ for workers and 1 - λ for capitalists.

#### Aggregate Savings in Equilibrium

Total savings S is the sum of workers' and capitalists' savings:

$$
S = s_w (\lambda Y) + s_c ((1 - \lambda) Y) = [s_w \lambda + s_c (1 - \lambda)] Y
$$

Substitute Y:

$$
S = [s_w \lambda + s_c (1 - λ)] \cdot \frac{\bar{I}}{s_w \lambda + s_c (1 - \lambda)} = \bar{I}
$$

Alternatively, since Y = C + Ī and S = Y - C, S = Ī. This confirms the savings-investment equality: in equilibrium, total savings equal the fixed investment, a fundamental Keynesian result.

#### Analyzing Parameter Changes

We now examine two scenarios: increasing savings propensities (s\_w and s\_c) and increasing workers' income share (λ), with s\_w > s\_c.

##### Scenario 1: Increasing Savings Propensities (s\_w and s\_c)

- **Effect on Income (Y):** From Y = Ī / \[s\_w λ + s\_c (1 - λ)\], if s\_w increases, s\_w λ increases (since λ > 0), and if s\_c increases, s\_c (1 - λ) increases (since 1 - λ > 0). The denominator grows, so with Ī fixed, Y decreases.
- **Intuition:** Higher savings mean less consumption, reducing AD, so income falls to match lower demand.
- **Effect on Savings (S):** S = Ī, which is fixed, so S remains unchanged. This is the paradox of thrift: trying to save more reduces income, offsetting the higher savings rates, keeping total S = Ī.
- **Numerical Example:** Suppose λ = 0.7, s\_w = 0.2, s\_c = 0.1, Ī = 100. Then Y = 100 / \[0.2 *0.7 + 0.1* 0.3\] = 100 / 0.17 ≈ 588.24, S = 100. If s\_w = 0.25, s\_c = 0.15, Y = 100 / \[0.25 *0.7 + 0.15* 0.3\] = 100 / 0.22 ≈ 454.55, S = 100. Y decreased, S unchanged.

##### Scenario 2: Increasing Workers' Share (λ), with s\_w > s\_c

- **Effect on Income (Y):** Check the denominator s\_w λ + s\_c (1 - λ). Derivative with respect to λ is s\_w - s\_c, which is positive since s\_w > s\_c. So as λ increases, the denominator increases, Y decreases (Ī fixed).
- **Intuition:** Workers save more (s\_w > s\_c), so shifting income to them raises the average savings rate, reducing consumption and AD, lowering Y.
- **Effect on Savings (S):** S = Ī, unchanged. The composition shifts (more from workers, less from capitalists), but total S = Ī.
- **Numerical Example:** With λ = 0.8, s\_w = 0.2, s\_c = 0.1, Ī = 100, Y = 100 / \[0.2 *0.8 + 0.1* 0.2\] = 100 / 0.18 ≈ 555.56, S = 100. Compared to λ = 0.7, Y decreased from 588.24 to 555.56, S same.

#### Key Insights and Concepts

- **Equilibrium Income:** Determined by balancing AD with output, depending on consumption (via savings propensities and shares) and fixed investment.
- **Savings-Investment Equality:** S = Ī in equilibrium, ensuring the economy adjusts income to maintain this balance.
- **Paradox of Thrift:** Higher savings propensities reduce income without increasing total S, as the economy contracts.
- **Multiplier Effect:** The multiplier is 1 / \[1 - effective MPC\], where effective MPC = (1 - s\_w) λ + (1 - s\_c) (1 - λ). Higher savings rates reduce the multiplier, amplifying income drops for changes in Ī.

#### Summary Table: Effects of Parameter Changes

| Scenario | Effect on Income (Y) | Effect on Savings (S) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Increase s\_w and s\_c | Decreases | Unchanged (S = Ī) |
| Increase λ (with s\_w > s\_c) | Decreases | Unchanged (S = Ī) |

This table summarizes the outcomes, aligning with the analysis for Questions 9 and 10, where both scenarios lead to income decreasing and savings remaining unchanged.

#### Conclusion

This demand-determined model illustrates how income adjusts to equate AD with output. Equilibrium income is Y = Ī / \[s\_w λ + s\_c (1 - λ)\], and S = Ī. Changes increasing the savings rate (higher s\_w, s\_c, or λ when s\_w > s\_c) reduce Y but leave S unchanged due to the savings-investment equality. This comprehensive understanding prepares you for variations in the ISI MSQE exam, such as fiscal policy, open economy, or endogenous investment scenarios.

Other types of questions that may come, and other related theory

Below is a comprehensive response to your query about "other types of questions that may come, and other related theory" concerning a demand-determined economic model, tailored for preparation for exams like the ISI MSQE. This explanation assumes a Keynesian framework where output (income) is determined by aggregate demand, featuring workers and capitalists with different savings propensities and an autonomous investment component. I’ll outline potential question variations and expand on related theoretical concepts to deepen your understanding.

## Types of Questions That May Come

The ISI MSQE exam often tests your ability to apply economic models to diverse scenarios. Based on the demand-determined model with workers (saving propensity $s_w$  ), capitalists (saving propensity $s_c$  ), income distribution parameter $\lambda$  (workers’ share), and autonomous investment $\bar{I}$  , here are additional question types you might encounter:

### 1\. Changes in Savings Propensities

- **Question Example:** "How does equilibrium income change if workers’ savings propensity increases while capitalists’ decreases?"
- **Approach:** Equilibrium income is $Y = \frac{\bar{I}}{s_w \lambda + s_c (1 - \lambda)}$  . Analyze how shifts in $s_w$  and $s_c$  affect the denominator (average savings rate). If $s_w$  rises and $s_c$  falls, the net effect depends on their relative magnitudes and $\lambda$  .

### 2\. Shifts in Income Distribution

- **Question Example:** "What happens to output if the share of income to workers ( $\lambda$  ) increases?"
- **Approach:** If $s_w > s_c$  , increasing $\lambda$  raises the average savings rate, reducing $Y$  . Conversely, if $s_w < s_c$  , $Y$  increases. Test your understanding of how distribution impacts demand.

### 3\. Autonomous Investment Variations

- **Question Example:** "If autonomous investment doubles, what is the impact on income and savings?"
- **Approach:** Use the multiplier $\frac{1}{s_w \lambda + s_c (1 - \lambda)}$  . A change in $\bar{I}$  scales $Y$  proportionally, and savings adjust to equal the new $\bar{I}$  in equilibrium.

### 4\. Fiscal Policy Interventions

- **Question Example:** "Incorporate government spending $G$  or a lump-sum tax $T$  . How does this affect equilibrium?"
- **Approach:** Add $G$  to aggregate demand: $Y = \frac{\bar{I} + G}{s_w \lambda + s_c (1 - \lambda)}$  . For taxes, adjust workers’ or capitalists’ disposable income, reducing consumption and thus $Y$  .

### 5\. Open Economy Dynamics

- **Question Example:** "Introduce exports $X$  and imports $M = m Y$  . How does this alter income?"
- **Approach:** Aggregate demand becomes $AD = C_w + C_c + \bar{I} + X - m Y$  , yielding $Y = \frac{\bar{I} + X}{s_w \lambda + s_c (1 - \lambda) + m}$  . The import marginal propensity to import $m$  reduces the multiplier.

### 6\. Endogenous Investment

- **Question Example:** "Suppose investment is $I = a + b Y$  . How does this change equilibrium income?"
- **Approach:** Solve $Y = C_w + C_c + a + b Y$  , giving $Y = \frac{a}{1 - [(1 - s_w) \lambda + (1 - s_c) (1 - \lambda)] - b}$  . The endogenous component amplifies the multiplier effect.

### 7\. Stability and Dynamics

- **Question Example:** "Is the equilibrium stable? What happens if savings exceed investment initially?"
- **Approach:** If $S > I$  , inventories rise, reducing output until $S = I$  . Discuss adjustment processes and stability conditions.

### 8\. Comparative Statics with Constraints

- **Question Example:** "If $s_w$  increases but total savings must remain constant, how does $Y$  adjust?"
- **Approach:** Solve for $s_c$  to keep $S = \bar{I}$  , then recompute $Y$  . Tests algebraic manipulation and equilibrium understanding.

## Related Theory

To tackle these questions, you need a solid grasp of related Keynesian concepts and extensions. Here’s a detailed exploration:

### 1\. Basic Model Recap

- **Setup:** Income $Y$  is split: workers get $\lambda Y$  , capitalists $(1 - \lambda) Y$  . Workers consume $(1 - s_w) \lambda Y$  , capitalists $(1 - s_c) (1 - \lambda) Y$  . Investment is $\bar{I}$  .
- **Equilibrium:** $Y = AD = (1 - s_w) \lambda Y + (1 - s_c) (1 - \lambda) Y + \bar{I}$  .
- **Solution:** $Y = \frac{\bar{I}}{s_w \lambda + s_c (1 - \lambda)}$  , and savings $S = s_w \lambda Y + s_c (1 - \lambda) Y = \bar{I}$  .

### 2\. Multiplier Effect

- **Definition:** The multiplier is $\frac{1}{s_w \lambda + s_c (1 - \lambda)}$  , showing how $Y$  changes with autonomous spending (e.g., $\bar{I}$  , $G$  ).
- **Insight:** Higher savings rates reduce the multiplier, dampening demand shocks.

### 3\. Paradox of Thrift

- **Concept:** If everyone saves more (e.g., $s_w$  or $s_c$  increases), aggregate demand falls, reducing $Y$  . Total savings remain $S = \bar{I}$  , not rising as intended.
- **Example:** If $s_w = 0.3$  to 0.4, $Y$  drops, offsetting the savings increase.

### 4\. Income Distribution Effects

- **Theory:** Shifting income to higher savers (e.g., increasing $\lambda$  if $s_w > s_c$  ) reduces $Y$  , as more income is saved rather than spent.
- **Relevance:** Links macro outcomes to micro behavior.

### 5\. Fiscal Policy Multipliers

- **Government Spending:** $\Delta Y = \frac{\Delta G}{s_w \lambda + s_c (1 - \lambda)}$  .
- **Taxation:** Reduces disposable income, shrinking consumption and $Y$  . Lump-sum vs. proportional taxes alter effects.

### 6\. Open Economy Adjustments

- **Net Exports:** $X - M$  adds to AD. Imports $M = m Y$  leak demand abroad, reducing the domestic multiplier to $\frac{1}{s_w \lambda + s_c (1 - \lambda) + m}$  .
- **Trade Balance:** $S - I = X - M$  in equilibrium, tying savings to external accounts.

### 7\. Investment Functions

- **Endogeneity:** $I = a + b Y$  or $I = I(r)$  (interest rate dependent) introduces feedback loops, complicating stability analysis.
- **Accelerator Model:** Investment rises with income growth, amplifying cycles.

### 8\. Disequilibrium Dynamics

- **Adjustment:** If $AD < Y$  , output falls; if $AD > Y$  , inventories deplete, boosting production.
- **Stability:** Depends on the slope of AD vs. the 45-degree line in the Keynesian cross.

## Numerical Example

Let’s illustrate with $\lambda = 0.6$  , $s_w = 0.3$  , $s_c = 0.1$  , $\bar{I} = 100$  : Ascertain:

- **Baseline:** $Y = \frac{100}{0.3 \times 0.6 + 0.1 \times 0.4} = \frac{100}{0.18 + 0.04} = \frac{100}{0.22} \approx 454.55$  .
- **Increase $\bar{I}$  to 120:** $Y = \frac{120}{0.22} \approx 545.45$  , $\Delta Y = 90.9$  , multiplier = $\frac{90.9}{20} \approx 4.545$  .
- **Add $G = 50$  :** $Y = \frac{100 + 50}{0.22} = \frac{150}{0.22} \approx 681.82$  .

## Summary Table: Effects of Changes

| **Change** | **Effect on $Y$** | **Effect on $S$** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Increase $s_w$  or $s_c$ | Decreases | Unchanged ( $S = \bar{I}$  ) |
| Increase $\lambda$  ( $s_w > s_c$  ) | Decreases | Unchanged |
| Increase $\bar{I}$ | Increases | Increases ( $S = \text{new } \bar{I}$  ) |
| Add $G$ | Increases | Increases (if untaxed) |
| Add $M = m Y$ | Decreases | Adjusts to $\bar{I} + X - M$ |
