To determine which statement about the function $f(x) = |x| + x^2$  , defined for all real numbers $x \in \mathbb{R}$  , is correct, we need to evaluate each of the given options: (A) $f$  is differentiable, (B) $f$  is concave but not differentiable, (C) $f$  is convex but not differentiable, and (D) $f$  is discontinuous. Let’s analyze the function’s properties step by step, focusing on continuity, differentiability, and the shape of its graph (concavity or convexity).

---

### Step 1: Check Continuity

A function is continuous if there are no breaks or jumps in its graph. Since $f(x) = |x| + x^2$  is the sum of two functions, $|x|$  and $x^2$  , we can leverage their properties. The absolute value function $|x|$  is continuous everywhere, and the quadratic function $x^2$  is a polynomial, also continuous everywhere. The sum of continuous functions is continuous, so $f(x)$  should be continuous for all $x \in \mathbb{R}$  .

To confirm, consider the point $x = 0$  , where $|x|$  changes behavior:

- As $x \to 0^+$  , $f(x) = x + x^2 \to 0 + 0 = 0$  .
- As $x \to 0^-$  , $f(x) = -x + x^2 \to 0 + 0 = 0$  .
- At $x = 0$  , $f(0) = |0| + 0^2 = 0$  .

The left-hand limit, right-hand limit, and function value all equal 0, so $f$  is continuous at $x = 0$  . Elsewhere, $f(x)$  is a combination of polynomials ( $x + x^2$  for $x \geq 0$  and $-x + x^2$  for $x < 0$  ), which are continuous. Thus, $f$  is continuous everywhere, and option (D) “ $f$  is discontinuous” is incorrect.

---

### Step 2: Check Differentiability

A function is differentiable at a point if it has a derivative there, meaning the left-hand and right-hand derivatives exist and are equal. For $f$  to be differentiable over all real numbers (as option (A) implies), this must hold everywhere. Since $|x|$  has a corner at $x = 0$  , we should examine that point closely, but first, let’s compute the derivative where possible.

Define $f(x)$  piecewise:

- For $x \geq 0$  , $f(x) = x + x^2$  , so $f'(x) = 1 + 2x$  .
- For $x < 0$  , $f(x) = -x + x^2$  , so $f'(x) = -1 + 2x$  .

Now, at $x = 0$  :

- **Right-hand derivative**:
	$$
	\lim_{h \to 0^+} \frac{f(0 + h) - f(0)}{h} = \lim_{h \to 0^+} \frac{f(h)}{h} = \lim_{h \to 0^+} \frac{h + h^2}{h} = \lim_{h \to 0^+} (1 + h) = 1
	$$
- **Left-hand derivative**:
	$$
	\lim_{h \to 0^-} \frac{f(0 + h) - f(0)}{h} = \lim_{h \to 0^-} \frac{f(h)}{h} = \lim_{h \to 0^-} \frac{-h + h^2}{h} = \lim_{h \to 0^-} (-1 + h) = -1
	$$

Since the right-hand derivative (1) does not equal the left-hand derivative ( $-1$ ), $f$  is not differentiable at $x = 0$  . For $x \neq 0$  , the derivatives $1 + 2x$  and $-1 + 2x$  are well-defined (e.g., at $x = 1$  , $f'(x) = 3$  ; at $x = -1$  , $f'(x) = -3$  ). However, option (A) “ $f$  is differentiable” typically means differentiable everywhere in its domain. Since $f$  fails at $x = 0$  , option (A) is incorrect.

---

### Step 3: Check Convexity and Concavity

Options (B) and (C) involve concavity and convexity, alongside differentiability. A function is:

- **Convex** if its graph curves upward (like a cup), meaning for any $x, y \in \mathbb{R}$  and $\lambda \in [0,1]$  , $f(\lambda x + (1 - \lambda) y) \leq \lambda f(x) + (1 - \lambda) f(y)$  . If the second derivative exists and is positive, the function is convex where differentiable.
- **Concave** if its graph curves downward (like a cap), meaning the inequality reverses: $f(\lambda x + (1 - \lambda) y) \geq \lambda f(x) + (1 - \lambda) f(y)$  . A negative second derivative indicates concavity.

#### Second Derivative Analysis

Since $f$  is not differentiable at $x = 0$  , we compute the second derivative where it exists:

- For $x > 0$  , $f'(x) = 1 + 2x$  , so $f''(x) = 2 > 0$  .
- For $x < 0$  , $f'(x) = -1 + 2x$  , so $f''(x) = 2 > 0$  .

Wherever $f''(x)$  exists ( $x \neq 0$  ), it is positive, suggesting the function curves upward, which aligns with convexity. At $x = 0$  , we can’t compute $f''(x)$  , but convexity doesn’t require differentiability everywhere—only that the function’s graph lies below its secant lines.

#### Convexity via Definition

Test the convexity condition with points across $x = 0$  , say $x = -1$  , $y = 1$  , $\lambda = 0.5$  :

- $f(-1) = |-1| + (-1)^2 = 1 + 1 = 2$
- $f(1) = |1| + 1^2 = 1 + 1 = 2$
- $\lambda x + (1 - \lambda) y = 0.5(-1) + 0.5(1) = 0$
- $f(0) = 0$
- $\lambda f(x) + (1 - \lambda) f(y) = 0.5 \cdot 2 + 0.5 \cdot 2 = 1 + 1 = 2$

Check: $f(0) = 0 \leq 2$  , which holds. Try $x = -1$  , $y = 0$  , $\lambda = 0.5$  :

- $f(-1) = 2$  , $f(0) = 0$
- $0.5(-1) + 0.5(0) = -0.5$
- $f(-0.5) = |-0.5| + (-0.5)^2 = 0.5 + 0.25 = 0.75$
- $0.5 \cdot 2 + 0.5 \cdot 0 = 1$

Check: $0.75 \leq 1$  , which holds. Since $f''(x) > 0$  where defined, and the convexity inequality holds (noting $f$  is continuous), $f$  is convex. For concavity, the second derivative would need to be negative, but $f''(x) = 2 > 0$  , so $f$  is not concave anywhere.

#### Alternative Insight: Sum of Convex Functions

Both $|x|$  and $x^2$  are convex ( $|x|$  is convex despite not being differentiable at 0; $x^2$  has $f''(x) = 2 > 0$  ). The sum of convex functions is convex, reinforcing that $f(x) = |x| + x^2$  is convex.

### Evaluate Options

- **(A) $f$  is differentiable**: False, as $f$  is not differentiable at $x = 0$  .
- **(B) $f$  is concave but not differentiable**: $f$  is not differentiable at $x = 0$  , but it’s convex, not concave, so this is false.
- **(C) $f$  is convex but not differentiable**: $f$  is convex (positive second derivative where it exists, satisfies convexity condition) and not differentiable at $x = 0$  , so this is true.
- **(D) $f$  is discontinuous**: False, as $f$  is continuous everywhere.

### Conclusion

The correct statement is (C) “ $f$  is convex but not differentiable,” as $f(x) = |x| + x^2$  is continuous, convex across its domain, and not differentiable at $x = 0$  .

rules to memorise that will cover all sorts of scenarios of these type of quesitions

Here’s a set of **rules to memorize** that will help you tackle questions involving functions like $f(x) = |x| + x^2$  or similar types, where you need to determine properties such as **continuity**, **differentiability**, **concavity**, and **convexity**. These guidelines are designed to cover a wide range of scenarios systematically.

---

### Rule 1: Check Continuity First

- **What to do**: Confirm that the function has no breaks or jumps in its graph.
- **How**:
	- For functions with absolute values (e.g., $|x|$  ), check continuity at critical points like $x = 0$  by ensuring the left-hand limit, right-hand limit, and function value are equal.
	- For sums of functions, if each part is continuous everywhere (e.g., $|x|$  and $x^2$  ), the sum is continuous everywhere.
- **Example**: For $f(x) = |x| + x^2$  , both $|x|$  and $x^2$  are continuous for all $x$  , so $f(x)$  is continuous everywhere.

---

### Rule 2: Check Differentiability at Critical Points

- **What to do**: Determine if the function has a derivative at points where its definition might change (e.g., $x = 0$  for $|x|$  ).
- **How**:
	- Compute the **left-hand derivative** and **right-hand derivative** at the critical point.
	- If they are unequal, the function is not differentiable there (e.g., a corner or cusp exists).
- **Example**: For $f(x) = |x| + x^2$  at $x = 0$  :
	- Right-hand derivative: $\lim_{h \to 0^+} \frac{f(h) - f(0)}{h} = \lim_{h \to 0^+} \frac{h + h^2}{h} = 1$
	- Left-hand derivative: $\lim_{h \to 0^-} \frac{f(h) - f(0)}{h} = \lim_{h \to 0^-} \frac{-h + h^2}{h} = -1$
	- Since $1 \neq -1$  , $f(x)$  is not differentiable at $x = 0$  .

---

### Rule 3: Analyze Convexity/Concavity Using Second Derivatives

- **What to do**: Assess the curvature of the function to determine if it’s convex (concave up) or concave (concave down).
- **How**:
	- Compute the second derivative $f''(x)$  where it exists.
	- If $f''(x) > 0$  , the function is **convex** in that region.
	- If $f''(x) < 0$  , the function is **concave** in that region.
- **Example**: For $f(x) = |x| + x^2$  :
	- For $x > 0$  , $f(x) = x + x^2$  , so $f'(x) = 1 + 2x$  , $f''(x) = 2 > 0$  .
	- For $x < 0$  , $f(x) = -x + x^2$  , so $f'(x) = -1 + 2x$  , $f''(x) = 2 > 0$  .
	- Since $f''(x) = 2 > 0$  where defined, the function is convex away from $x = 0$  .

---

### Rule 4: Use the Definition of Convexity at Non-Differentiable Points

- **What to do**: Check convexity at points where the second derivative doesn’t exist (e.g., $x = 0$  ).
- **How**:
	- Use the convexity condition: $f(\lambda x + (1 - \lambda) y) \leq \lambda f(x) + (1 - \lambda) f(y)$  for $0 < \lambda < 1$  and points $x, y$  around the critical point.
- **Example**: For $f(x) = |x| + x^2$  , test $x = -1$  , $y = 1$  , $\lambda = 0.5$  :
	- $f(0) = 0$
	- $0.5 f(-1) + 0.5 f(1) = 0.5(2) + 0.5(2) = 2$
	- $0 \leq 2$  holds, supporting that $f(x)$  is convex at $x = 0$  .

---

### Rule 5: Leverage Properties of Sums of Functions

- **What to do**: Use known properties of the individual components to infer properties of the sum.
- **How**:
	- **Continuity**: The sum of continuous functions is continuous.
	- **Differentiability**: The sum is differentiable only where all components are differentiable, so check critical points.
	- **Convexity**: The sum of convex functions is convex.
- **Example**: For $f(x) = |x| + x^2$  , both $|x|$  and $x^2$  are convex (since their second derivatives are non-negative where defined), so $f(x)$  is convex everywhere.

---

### Rule 6: Consider Behavior as x→±∞ x \\to \\pm \\infty

- **What to do**: Examine the function’s long-term behavior to confirm properties like convexity or concavity.
- **How**:
	- Identify the dominant term for large $|x|$  .
	- Analyze its contribution to the function’s shape.
- **Example**: For $f(x) = |x| + x^2$  , as $|x| \to \infty$  , $x^2$  dominates (grows faster than $|x|$  ), and since $x^2$  is convex, $f(x)$  remains convex.

---

### Rule 7: Sketch the Function or Plot Key Points

- **What to do**: Visualize the function to confirm your conclusions about continuity, differentiability, and curvature.
- **How**:
	- Evaluate the function at key points (e.g., $x = 0$  , $x = \pm 1$  ).
	- Note sharp corners (non-differentiability) and the overall shape (upward or downward curvature).
- **Example**: For $f(x) = |x| + x^2$  :
	- $f(0) = 0$
	- $f(1) = 1 + 1 = 2$
	- $f(-1) = 1 + 1 = 2$
	- The graph has a corner at $x = 0$  (non-differentiable) and curves upward, indicating convexity.

---

### Summary of Rules

When analyzing a function like $f(x) = |x| + x^2$  or similar:

1. **Check continuity** at critical points and across the domain.
2. **Check differentiability** by comparing left-hand and right-hand derivatives at critical points.
3. **Analyze convexity/concavity** with second derivatives where possible.
4. **Test convexity** at non-differentiable points using the definition.
5. **Use properties of sums** to simplify your analysis.
6. **Examine asymptotic behavior** to understand the function’s shape.
7. **Sketch the function** to visualize and confirm your findings.

By applying these rules systematically, you’ll be equipped to handle a variety of scenarios involving absolute values, polynomials, or other combined functions! https://grok.com/chat/8aefc343-75a2-4d6a-8a44-aaaf97133bbc
