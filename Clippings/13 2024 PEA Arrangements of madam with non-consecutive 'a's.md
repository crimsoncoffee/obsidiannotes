To determine the number of possible arrangements of the letters in the word "madam" such that the two 'a's never appear in consecutive positions, we need to consider the total arrangements of the letters and adjust for the given condition. The word "madam" has 5 letters: m, a, d, a, m, with two identical 'm's, two identical 'a's, and one 'd'. Let's solve this step-by-step.

### Step 1: Total Number of Arrangements Without Restrictions

First, calculate the total number of distinct arrangements of the letters in "madam" without any conditions. Since there are 5 letters with repetitions (two 'm's and two 'a's), we use the formula for permutations of a multiset:

$$
\text{Total arrangements} = \frac{n!}{k_1! \cdot k_2! \cdot \ldots \cdot k_t!}
$$

Here, $n = 5$  (total letters), and the frequencies are:

- 'm': 2,
- 'a': 2,
- 'd': 1.

So:

$$
\text{Total arrangements} = \frac{5!}{2! \cdot 2! \cdot 1!} = \frac{120}{2 \cdot 2 \cdot 1} = \frac{120}{4} = 30
$$

Thus, there are 30 possible arrangements of the letters in "madam" without any restrictions.

### Step 2: Arrangements Where the Two 'a's Are Consecutive

Next, compute the number of arrangements where the two 'a's are consecutive, as we can subtract this from the total to find the cases where they are not consecutive. Treat the two 'a's as a single unit, say "(aa)". This reduces the problem to arranging 4 units: (aa), m, d, m, where there are two identical 'm's.

The number of distinct arrangements of these 4 units is:

$$
\frac{4!}{2!} = \frac{24}{2} = 12
$$

So, there are 12 arrangements where the two 'a's appear consecutively (e.g., "aamdm", "maamd", "mdmaa", etc.).

### Step 3: Arrangements Where the Two 'a's Are Not Consecutive

To find the number of arrangements where the two 'a's are not consecutive, subtract the number of arrangements where they are consecutive from the total:

$$
\text{Arrangements with 'a's not consecutive} = 30 - 12 = 18
$$

### Alternative Approach: Direct Calculation

To confirm, let's use a direct method by placing the 'a's in non-consecutive positions and arranging the remaining letters. There are 5 positions in the word, and we need to choose 2 positions for the 'a's (which are identical) such that they are not adjacent. Then, place the remaining letters (m, m, d) in the 3 remaining positions.

- **Total ways to choose 2 positions out of 5**: Since the 'a's are identical, we compute combinations:
$$
C(5, 2) = \frac{5 \cdot 4}{2 \cdot 1} = 10
$$
- **Ways where the 'a's are consecutive**: In 5 positions, the consecutive pairs are (1,2), (2,3), (3,4), and (4,5)—a total of 4 pairs.
- **Ways where the 'a's are not consecutive**:
$$
10 - 4 = 6
$$

So, there are 6 ways to place the two 'a's in non-consecutive positions (e.g., positions 1 and 3, 1 and 4, 1 and 5, 2 and 4, 2 and 5, 3 and 5).

- **Arrange the remaining letters**: For each placement of the 'a's, 3 positions remain for m, m, d (two identical 'm's):
$$
\frac{3!}{2!} = \frac{6}{2} = 3
$$
- **Total arrangements**:
$$
6 \cdot 3 = 18
$$

This matches our earlier result, reinforcing confidence in the answer.

### Verification

Both methods—the subtraction approach (30 - 12 = 18) and the direct placement approach (6 \* 3 = 18)—yield 18, suggesting consistency. The options provided are (A) 30, (B) 24, (C) 18, and (D) 12. Option (C) 18 aligns with our calculation.

### Final Answer

The number of possible arrangements of the letters in "madam" such that the two 'a's never appear in consecutive positions is **18**. Thus, the correct answer is option (C). https://grok.com/chat/615071e9-5193-4946-971b-68250c02b5a1
