To determine the number of polynomials of the form $x^3 + a x^2 + b x + c$  that are divisible by $x^2 + 1$  , where $a, b, c \in \{1, 2, \ldots, 10\}$  , we need to ensure that $x^2 + 1$  is a factor of the given cubic polynomial. Let’s solve this step-by-step.

---

### Step 1: Understanding Divisibility

A polynomial $p(x) = x^3 + a x^2 + b x + c$  is divisible by $x^2 + 1$  if $x^2 + 1$  is a factor of $p(x)$  . Since $x^2 + 1$  is a quadratic polynomial (degree 2) and $p(x)$  is cubic (degree 3), if $x^2 + 1$  divides $p(x)$  , the quotient must be a linear polynomial (degree 1), because $2 + 1 = 3$  . Thus, we can express:

$p(x) = (x^2 + 1) \cdot (d x + e)$

where $d$  and $e$  are constants, and the leading coefficient of $p(x)$  is 1 (the coefficient of $x^3$  ). Expanding the right-hand side:

$(x^2 + 1)(d x + e) = d x^3 + e x^2 + d x + e$

Equating this to the given polynomial $p(x) = x^3 + a x^2 + b x + c$  , we compare coefficients:

- **Coefficient of $x^3$** : $d = 1$  (since the leading coefficient of $p(x)$  is 1).
- **Coefficient of $x^2$** : $e = a$  .
- **Coefficient of $x$** : $d = b$  , so $b = 1$  .
- **Constant term**: $e = c$  , so $c = e$  .

Since $e = a$  and $e = c$  , it follows that $c = a$  . Thus, the polynomial must be:

$p(x) = (x^2 + 1)(x + a) = x^3 + a x^2 + x + a$

This implies:

- $a = a$  (the coefficient of $x^2$  ),
- $b = 1$  (the coefficient of $x$  ),
- $c = a$  (the constant term).

### Step 2: Verify the Divisibility Condition

Alternatively, since $x^2 + 1$  has roots at $x = i$  and $x = -i$  (because $x^2 + 1 = (x - i)(x + i)$  ), if $x^2 + 1$  divides $p(x)$  , then $p(i) = 0$  and $p(-i) = 0$  . Compute $p(i)$  for $p(x) = x^3 + a x^2 + b x + c$  :

$p(i) = i^3 + a i^2 + b i + c$

Using $i^2 = -1$  and $i^3 = i \cdot i^2 = -i$  :

$p(i) = -i + a (-1) + b i + c = (-a + c) + (b - 1) i$

Set $p(i) = 0$  :

$(-a + c) + (b - 1) i = 0$

Since this is a complex number, the real and imaginary parts must both be zero:

- **Real part**: $-a + c = 0 \Rightarrow c = a$  ,
- **Imaginary part**: $b - 1 = 0 \Rightarrow b = 1$  .

Since $p(x)$  has real coefficients, if $p(i) = 0$  , then $p(-i) = 0$  automatically (complex roots come in conjugate pairs), so we don’t need to check $p(-i)$  separately. This confirms that $b = 1$  and $c = a$  .

Thus, the polynomial is:

$p(x) = x^3 + a x^2 + x + a$

---

### Step 3: Check Constraints

The problem states $a, b, c \in \{1, 2, \ldots, 10\}$  . With $b = 1$  and $c = a$  :

- $b = 1$  , which is in $\{1, 2, \ldots, 10\}$  ,
- $a$  ranges from 1 to 10,
- $c = a$  , so if $a$  is from 1 to 10, then $c$  is also from 1 to 10.

This satisfies all given conditions.

---

### Step 4: Count the Polynomials

Since $b$  is fixed at 1, and $c = a$  , the number of possible polynomials depends on the choices for $a$  . There are 10 possible values for $a$  (1 through 10), and for each:

- $b = 1$  ,
- $c = a$  .

Each choice of $a$  gives a distinct polynomial:

- If $a = 1$  : $p(x) = x^3 + x^2 + x + 1$  ,
- If $a = 2$  : $p(x) = x^3 + 2 x^2 + x + 2$  ,
- ...
- If $a = 10$  : $p(x) = x^3 + 10 x^2 + x + 10$  .

There are exactly 10 polynomials.

---

### Step 5: Confirm with Division

Perform polynomial division of $p(x) = x^3 + a x^2 + x + a$  by $x^2 + 1$  :

- Divide $x^3$  by $x^2$  : quotient term is $x$  ,
- $(x^2 + 1) \cdot x = x^3 + x$  ,
- Subtract: $(x^3 + a x^2 + x + a) - (x^3 + x) = a x^2 + a$  ,
- Divide $a x^2$  by $x^2$  : quotient term is $a$  ,
- $(x^2 + 1) \cdot a = a x^2 + a$  ,
- Subtract: $(a x^2 + a) - (a x^2 + a) = 0$  .

The remainder is 0, confirming that $x^2 + 1$  divides $p(x)$  when $b = 1$  and $c = a$  .

---

### Step 6: Are There Other Solutions?

If $b \neq 1$  , the remainder when dividing by $x^2 + 1$  is $(b - 1) x + (c - a)$  , which is zero only if $b - 1 = 0$  and $c - a = 0$  , i.e., $b = 1$  and $c = a$  . Thus, no other values of $b$  work within the constraints.

---

### Final Answer

The number of polynomials is the number of choices for $a$  , which is 10. The answer corresponds to option (B).

**Answer: 10**

how could I have done it quickly in a fast exam, thoughts processes etc

To solve the problem of finding how many polynomials of the form $x^3 + a x^2 + b x + c$ , with $a, b, c$ integers from 1 to 10, are divisible by $x^2 + 1$ quickly in a fast exam setting, here’s an efficient thought process you can follow:

### Step 1: Understand Divisibility

A polynomial $p(x) = x^3 + a x^2 + b x + c$ is divisible by $x^2 + 1$ if $x^2 + 1$ is a factor of $p(x)$ . Since $x^2 + 1$ is a quadratic polynomial (degree 2) and $p(x)$ is cubic (degree 3), if $x^2 + 1$ divides $p(x)$ , the quotient must be a linear polynomial (degree 1), because $2 + 1 = 3$ . Additionally, the leading coefficient of $p(x)$ is 1, and the leading coefficient of $x^2 + 1$ is 1, so the quotient likely has a leading coefficient of 1, suggesting a form like $x + e$ .

### Step 2: Use Polynomial Factorization

Assume: $p(x) = (x^2 + 1)(x + e)$  Expand this: $(x^2 + 1)(x + e) = x^2 \cdot x + x^2 \cdot e + 1 \cdot x + 1 \cdot e = x^3 + e x^2 + x + e$  Now, compare this to the given polynomial: $p(x) = x^3 + a x^2 + b x + c$  Equate coefficients:

- Coefficient of $x^3$ : $1 = 1$ (matches automatically),
- Coefficient of $x^2$ : $a = e$ ,
- Coefficient of $x$ : $b = 1$ ,
- Constant term: $c = e$ .

Since $a = e$ and $c = e$ , it follows that: $c = a$  And: $b = 1$  So, the polynomial must be of the form: $p(x) = x^3 + a x^2 + x + a$  with $b = 1$ and $c = a$ .

### Step 3: Alternative Approach with Roots (Even Faster)

Since $x^2 + 1 = (x - i)(x + i)$ , where $i = \sqrt{-1}$ , if $x^2 + 1$ divides $p(x)$ , then $p(x)$ must be zero at the roots of $x^2 + 1$ , which are $x = i$ and $x = -i$ . Compute $p(i)$ : $p(i) = i^3 + a i^2 + b i + c$  Using $i^2 = -1$ and $i^3 = i \cdot i^2 = -i$ : $p(i) = -i + a (-1) + b i + c = -a + c + (-1 + b)i$  For $p(i) = 0$ , the real and imaginary parts must both be zero:

- Real part: $-a + c = 0 \implies c = a$ ,
- Imaginary part: $-1 + b = 0 \implies b = 1$ .

Since the coefficients are real, if $p(i) = 0$ , then $p(-i) = 0$ automatically (complex roots come in conjugate pairs), so no need to check $p(-i)$ . This confirms: $b = 1, \quad c = a$

### Step 4: Count Possibilities

Given $a, b, c \in \{1, 2, \ldots, 10\}$ :

- $b = 1$ , which is in the set,
- $c = a$ , and $a$ can be any integer from 1 to 10,
- Since $c = a$ , and $a$ ranges from 1 to 10, $c$ also stays within 1 to 10.

Thus, for each value of $a$ from 1 to 10, with $b = 1$ and $c = a$ , you get a distinct polynomial:

- $a = 1$ : $x^3 + 1 \cdot x^2 + 1 \cdot x + 1$ ,
- $a = 2$ : $x^3 + 2 x^2 + 1 \cdot x + 2$ ,
- ...
- $a = 10$ : $x^3 + 10 x^2 + 1 \cdot x + 10$ .

There are exactly 10 possible values for $a$ , so there are 10 such polynomials.

### Step 5: Quick Verification

To ensure correctness under time pressure:

- Test $a = 1$ : $p(x) = x^3 + x^2 + x + 1 = (x^2 + 1)(x + 1)$ , which works.
- The condition $b = 1$ , $c = a$ consistently makes $x^2 + 1$ a factor, as shown by the factorization or roots method.

### Fast Exam Strategy

1. **Recognize the Pattern**: A cubic divisible by a quadratic suggests factoring as $(x^2 + 1)(x + e)$ .
2. **Match Coefficients**: Quickly see that $b = 1$ , $c = a$ .
3. **Count**: $a$ has 10 choices, $b$ is fixed, $c$ follows $a$ , so total is 10.
4. **Or Use Roots**: Evaluate $p(i) = 0$ , solve in 10 seconds to get the same conditions, then count.

This approach takes about 30–60 seconds with practice, ideal for a fast exam. The final answer is 10. https://grok.com/chat/90406c89-944f-4b37-a3da-1564b2b761bc
