To determine the total number of balls contained in $N$  boxes, where each box contains at most $r$  balls and $N_i$  represents the number of boxes with at least $i$  balls for $i = 1, 2, \ldots, r$  , we need to derive a formula based on the given information and select the correct multiple-choice option.

---

### Understanding the Problem

- **$N$** : Total number of boxes.
- **$r$** : Maximum number of balls any box can contain (so each box has 0 to $r$  balls).
- **$N_i$** : Number of boxes containing at least $i$  balls, defined for $i = 1, 2, \ldots, r$  .
- **Goal**: Find the total number of balls across all $N$  boxes using the $N_i$  values.

For example:

- $N_1$  : Number of boxes with at least 1 ball (all non-empty boxes).
- $N_2$  : Number of boxes with at least 2 balls.
- $N_r$  : Number of boxes with at least $r$  balls, which, since $r$  is the maximum, means exactly $r$  balls.

Since no box can have more than $r$  balls, if a box has at least $r$  balls, it has exactly $r$  balls, so $N_r$  counts boxes with exactly $r$  balls.

### Deriving the Total Number of Balls

Let’s denote the number of balls in box $j$  as $m_j$  , where $0 \leq m_j \leq r$  . The total number of balls is:

$$
\text{Total balls} = m_1 + m_2 + \cdots + m_N
$$

We need to express this sum in terms of $N_i$  . One intuitive approach is to count how many balls each box contributes by determining the number of boxes with exactly $k$  balls for each $k = 0, 1, \ldots, r$  , then multiply by $k$  and sum.

#### Step 1: Number of Boxes with Exactly k k Balls

- **Exactly 0 balls**: Total boxes minus those with at least 1 ball:
	$$
	N - N_1
	$$
- **Exactly 1 ball**: Boxes with at least 1 ball minus those with at least 2 balls:
	$$
	N_1 - N_2
	$$
- **Exactly 2 balls**: Boxes with at least 2 balls minus those with at least 3 balls:
	$$
	N_2 - N_3
	$$
- **Generally, for $k = 1$  to $r-1$** :
	$$
	N_k - N_{k+1}
	$$
- **Exactly $r$  balls**: Boxes with at least $r$  balls, and since $r$  is the maximum, no box has more than $r$  :
	$$
	N_r - N_{r+1}
	$$
	 But $N_{r+1} = 0$  (no boxes have at least $r+1$  balls), so:
	$$
	N_r - 0 = N_r
	$$

This is consistent: $N_r$  is the number of boxes with exactly $r$  balls.

#### Step 2: Total Number of Balls

The total number of balls is the sum of $k$  times the number of boxes with exactly $k$  balls, from $k = 0$  to $r$  :

$$
\text{Total balls} = \sum_{k=0}^{r} k \cdot (\text{number of boxes with exactly } k \text{ balls})
$$
- For $k = 0$  : $0 \cdot (N - N_1) = 0$
- For $k = 1$  to $r-1$  : $k \cdot (N_k - N_{k+1})$
- For $k = r$  : $r \cdot N_r$

So:

$$
\text{Total balls} = 0 \cdot (N - N_1) + \sum_{k=1}^{r-1} k \cdot (N_k - N_{k+1}) + r \cdot N_r
$$

Since the $k = 0$  term is zero, we have:

$$
\text{Total balls} = \sum_{k=1}^{r} k \cdot (N_k - N_{k+1})
$$

where $N_{r+1} = 0$  .

#### Step 3: Simplifying the Sum

Expand the expression:

$$
\text{Total balls} = 1 \cdot (N_1 - N_2) + 2 \cdot (N_2 - N_3) + 3 \cdot (N_3 - N_4) + \cdots + (r-1) \cdot (N_{r-1} - N_r) + r \cdot (N_r - 0)
$$
 
$$
= 1 N_1 - 1 N_2 + 2 N_2 - 2 N_3 + 3 N_3 - 3 N_4 + \cdots + (r-1) N_{r-1} - (r-1) N_r + r N_r
$$

Group coefficients for each $N_i$  :

- $N_1$  : $+1$  (coefficient 1)
- $N_2$  : $-1 + 2 = 1$
- $N_3$  : $-2 + 3 = 1$
- $\ldots$
- $N_k$  (for $k = 2$  to $r-1$  ): $-(k-1) + k = 1$
- $N_r$  : $-(r-1) + r = 1$

Thus:

$$
\text{Total balls} = 1 \cdot N_1 + 1 \cdot N_2 + 1 \cdot N_3 + \cdots + 1 \cdot N_r = \sum_{i=1}^{r} N_i
$$

#### Alternative Approach: Counting Contributions

Consider each box’s contribution. For a box with exactly $m$  balls:

- It is included in $N_i$  for $i = 1, 2, \ldots, m$  (since it has at least $i$  balls when $i \leq m$  ).
- It is not in $N_i$  for $i = m+1, \ldots, r$  (since it has fewer than $i$  balls).

The number of $N_i$  ’s including this box is $m$  , which is the number of balls in the box. Summing over all boxes:

$$
\text{Total balls} = \sum_{\text{boxes } j} m_j
$$

For box $j$  with $m_j$  balls, $m_j = \sum_{i=1}^{r} 1_{\{m_j \geq i\}}$  (where $1_{\{m_j \geq i\}} = 1$  if $m_j \geq i$  , else 0). So:

$$
\text{Total balls} = \sum_{j=1}^{N} \sum_{i=1}^{r} 1_{\{m_j \geq i\}}
$$

Reverse the summation order:

$$
= \sum_{i=1}^{r} \sum_{j=1}^{N} 1_{\{m_j \geq i\}}
$$

The inner sum $\sum_{j=1}^{N} 1_{\{m_j \geq i\}} = N_i$  , so:

$$
\text{Total balls} = \sum_{i=1}^{r} N_i
$$

Both methods agree!

### Verification with Examples

1. **$N = 3$  , $r = 3$  , boxes have 0, 1, 2 balls)**:
	- $N_1 = 2$  , $N_2 = 1$  , $N_3 = 0$
	- $N_1 + N_2 + N_3 = 2 + 1 + 0 = 3$
	- Total balls = $0 + 1 + 2 = 3$  . Matches.
2. **$N = 2$  , $r = 2$  , both boxes have 2 balls)**:
	- $N_1 = 2$  , $N_2 = 2$
	- $N_1 + N_2 = 2 + 2 = 4$
	- Total balls = $2 + 2 = 4$  . Matches.
3. **$N = 4$  , $r = 3$  , boxes have 0, 1, 2, 3 balls)**:
	- $N_1 = 3$  , $N_2 = 2$  , $N_3 = 1$
	- $N_1 + N_2 + N_3 = 3 + 2 + 1 = 6$
	- Total balls = $0 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 6$  . Matches.

### Conclusion

The total number of balls is:

$$
N_1 + N_2 + \cdots + N_r
$$

Comparing with the options:

- (A) cannot be determined: Incorrect, as we derived an exact formula.
- (B) is exactly equal to $N_1 + N_2 + \cdots + N_r$  : Correct.
- (C) is strictly larger: Incorrect, as it equals, not exceeds, the sum.
- (D) is strictly smaller: Incorrect, as it matches the sum exactly.

Thus, the answer is option (B).

it says the box contains atleast i balls

It seems there might be a misunderstanding in your query: "it says the box contains at least i balls." I assume you're referring to a problem where there are $N$  boxes, each containing at most $r$  balls, and for each $i$  from 1 to $r$  , $N_i$  is defined as the number of boxes that contain at least $i$  balls. Your question appears to be about finding the total number of balls across all boxes, possibly choosing from multiple-choice options. Let me clarify this step-by-step and provide a complete solution.

---

### Problem Interpretation

We have:

- $N$  boxes in total.
- Each box contains at most $r$  balls, meaning the number of balls in any box is between 0 and $r$  (inclusive).
- For each $i$  from 1 to $r$  , $N_i$  is the number of boxes that have at least $i$  balls.
- We need to determine the total number of balls in all $N$  boxes.

The key is to express the total number of balls using the given $N_i$  values.

---

### Solution Approach

To find the total number of balls, consider that each box contributes a certain number of balls based on how many balls it contains. If a box has exactly $k$  balls (where $0 \leq k \leq r$  ), it contributes $k$  balls to the total. Our goal is to relate this to $N_1, N_2, \ldots, N_r$  .

#### Step 1: Understanding Ni N\_i

- $N_1$  : Number of boxes with at least 1 ball (all non-empty boxes).
- $N_2$  : Number of boxes with at least 2 balls.
- ...
- $N_r$  : Number of boxes with at least $r$  balls. Since $r$  is the maximum number of balls a box can have, these boxes have exactly $r$  balls (because they cannot exceed $r$  ).

Since no box can have more than $r$  balls, if a box has at least $r$  balls, it must have exactly $r$  balls. Thus, $N_{r+1} = 0$  (no boxes have at least $r+1$  balls).

#### Step 2: Counting Boxes with Exactly k k Balls

We can compute the number of boxes with exactly $k$  balls using the $N_i$  values:

- **Exactly 0 balls**: Total boxes minus those with at least 1 ball = $N - N_1$  .
- **Exactly 1 ball**: Boxes with at least 1 ball minus those with at least 2 balls = $N_1 - N_2$  .
- **Exactly 2 balls**: Boxes with at least 2 balls minus those with at least 3 balls = $N_2 - N_3$  .
- ...
- **Exactly $k$  balls** (for $1 \leq k \leq r-1$  ): $N_k - N_{k+1}$  .
- **Exactly $r$  balls**: Boxes with at least $r$  balls, and since no box has more than $r$  balls, this is $N_r - N_{r+1} = N_r - 0 = N_r$  .

#### Step 3: Total Number of Balls

The total number of balls is the sum of the balls in each box:

- Boxes with 0 balls contribute $0 \times (N - N_1) = 0$  .
- Boxes with 1 ball contribute $1 \times (N_1 - N_2)$  .
- Boxes with 2 balls contribute $2 \times (N_2 - N_3)$  .
- ...
- Boxes with $r$  balls contribute $r \times N_r$  .

So, the total number of balls is:

$$
\text{Total balls} = 0 \cdot (N - N_1) + 1 \cdot (N_1 - N_2) + 2 \cdot (N_2 - N_3) + \cdots + (r-1) \cdot (N_{r-1} - N_r) + r \cdot N_r
$$

The first term is zero, so:

$$
\text{Total balls} = 1 \cdot (N_1 - N_2) + 2 \cdot (N_2 - N_3) + \cdots + (r-1) \cdot (N_{r-1} - N_r) + r \cdot N_r
$$

#### Step 4: Simplifying the Expression

Let’s expand and combine like terms:

- $1 \cdot (N_1 - N_2) = N_1 - N_2$
- $2 \cdot (N_2 - N_3) = 2 N_2 - 2 N_3$
- $3 \cdot (N_3 - N_4) = 3 N_3 - 3 N_4$
- ...
- $(r-1) \cdot (N_{r-1} - N_r) = (r-1) N_{r-1} - (r-1) N_r$
- $r \cdot N_r = r N_r$

Write the sum:

$$
N_1 - N_2 + 2 N_2 - 2 N_3 + 3 N_3 - 3 N_4 + \cdots + (r-1) N_{r-1} - (r-1) N_r + r N_r
$$

Group coefficients:

- $N_1$  : $+1$  (coefficient 1)
- $N_2$  : $-1 + 2 = 1$
- $N_3$  : $-2 + 3 = 1$
- ...
- $N_r$  : $-(r-1) + r = 1$

The expression simplifies to:

$$
N_1 + N_2 + N_3 + \cdots + N_r
$$

#### Step 5: Alternative Perspective

Consider a box with exactly $k$  balls. It is counted in $N_1, N_2, \ldots, N_k$  (since it has at least $i$  balls for $i \leq k$  ), but not in $N_{k+1}, \ldots, N_r$  . In the sum $N_1 + N_2 + \cdots + N_r$  , this box contributes 1 for each $N_i$  from $i = 1$  to $k$  , totaling $k$  contributions—exactly the number of balls it has. Summing over all boxes, $N_1 + N_2 + \cdots + N_r$  equals the total number of balls.

#### Step 6: Verification with Examples

- **Example 1**: $N = 3$  , $r = 2$  , boxes have 0, 1, 2 balls.
	- $N_1 = 2$  , $N_2 = 1$
	- Total balls = $0 + 1 + 2 = 3$
	- $N_1 + N_2 = 2 + 1 = 3$  , matches.
- **Example 2**: $N = 2$  , $r = 2$  , boxes have 2, 2 balls.
	- $N_1 = 2$  , $N_2 = 2$
	- Total balls = $2 + 2 = 4$
	- $N_1 + N_2 = 2 + 2 = 4$  , matches.

---

### Final Answer

The total number of balls in all $N$  boxes is exactly equal to $N_1 + N_2 + \cdots + N_r$  . If your problem provides options like:

- (a) Cannot be determined
- (b) $N_1 + N_2 + \cdots + N_r$
- (c) Strictly larger than $N_1 + N_2 + \cdots + N_r$
- (d) Strictly smaller than $N_1 + N_2 + \cdots + N_r$

The correct choice is (b), as the total is precisely this sum.

illustrate the setup

To illustrate the setup described in your query, let’s break it down clearly and systematically. Imagine you have a collection of **N** boxes, each containing some number of balls. The number of balls in any single box is limited—it can be anywhere from 0 up to a maximum of **r** balls. For each integer **i** from 1 to **r**, you’re given a value **N\_i**, which represents the number of boxes that contain **at least i balls**. Your goal (implicitly, based on typical problems of this nature) is likely to understand how these **N\_i** values relate to the total number of balls across all boxes. Let’s explore this setup with a detailed explanation and examples.

### Understanding the Definitions

- **N**: The total number of boxes.
- **r**: The maximum number of balls any box can hold.
- **N\_i**: For each **i** from 1 to **r**, this is the count of boxes with at least **i** balls.
	- **N\_1**: Number of boxes with 1 or more balls.
	- **N\_2**: Number of boxes with 2 or more balls.
	- ...
	- **N\_r**: Number of boxes with **r** balls (since **r** is the maximum, these boxes have exactly **r** balls).

Since no box can have more than **r** balls, **N\_{r+1} = 0**, and the sequence of **N\_i** values decreases as **i** increases:

- **N\_1 ≥ N\_2 ≥ N\_3 ≥... ≥ N\_r ≥ 0**.

### Visualizing with an Example

Let’s illustrate this with a small, concrete example. Suppose:

- **N = 5** (there are 5 boxes).
- **r = 3** (the maximum number of balls per box is 3).
- The boxes contain: 0, 1, 2, 3, and 3 balls, respectively.

Now, calculate the **N\_i** values:

- **N\_1**: Boxes with at least 1 ball = {1, 2, 3, 3} → 4 boxes.
- **N\_2**: Boxes with at least 2 balls = {2, 3, 3} → 3 boxes.
- **N\_3**: Boxes with at least 3 balls = {3, 3} → 2 boxes.

So, we have:

- **N\_1 = 4**
- **N\_2 = 3**
- **N\_3 = 2**

Here’s a visual representation:

| Box Number | Balls | Contributes to N\_1? | Contributes to N\_2? | Contributes to N\_3? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 0 | No (0 < 1) | No (0 < 2) | No (0 < 3) |
| 2 | 1 | Yes (1 ≥ 1) | No (1 < 2) | No (1 < 3) |
| 3 | 2 | Yes (2 ≥ 1) | Yes (2 ≥ 2) | No (2 < 3) |
| 4 | 3 | Yes (3 ≥ 1) | Yes (3 ≥ 2) | Yes (3 ≥ 3) |
| 5 | 3 | Yes (3 ≥ 1) | Yes (3 ≥ 2) | Yes (3 ≥ 3) |
| **Count** |  | **N\_1 = 4** | **N\_2 = 3** | **N\_3 = 2** |

### Connecting to the Total Number of Balls

A natural question is how the total number of balls relates to **N\_1, N\_2,..., N\_r**. Let’s compute the total balls in this example:

- Total balls = 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 3 = **9**.

Now, sum the **N\_i** values:

- **N\_1 + N\_2 + N\_3 = 4 + 3 + 2 = 9**.

Interestingly, the sum matches the total number of balls! Is this a coincidence? Let’s explore why this happens.

### Why the Sum Works

Consider what each **N\_i** represents:

- A box with **k** balls (where **0 ≤ k ≤ r** ) is counted in **N\_1, N\_2,..., N\_k**, but not in **N\_{k+1},..., N\_r**.
- In the sum **N\_1 + N\_2 +... + N\_r**, this box is included **k** times—once for each **i** from 1 to **k**.

For our example:

- Box with 0 balls: Counted 0 times (not in any **N\_i** ), contributes 0 balls.
- Box with 1 ball: Counted 1 time (in **N\_1** ), contributes 1 ball.
- Box with 2 balls: Counted 2 times (in **N\_1, N\_2** ), contributes 2 balls.
- Box with 3 balls: Counted 3 times (in **N\_1, N\_2, N\_3** ), contributes 3 balls.

The sum **N\_1 + N\_2 +... + N\_r** effectively counts each box’s balls by including the box exactly as many times as the number of balls it has. Thus:

- Total number of balls = **N\_1 + N\_2 +... + N\_r**.

### Another Example for Confirmation

Let’s try **N = 3**, **r = 2**, with boxes containing 0, 1, and 2 balls:

- **N\_1** = 2 (boxes with 1 and 2 balls).
- **N\_2** = 1 (box with 2 balls).
- Total balls = 0 + 1 + 2 = **3**.
- Sum = **N\_1 + N\_2 = 2 + 1 = 3**. Matches again!

### Generalizing the Setup

For any **N** boxes, each with 0 to **r** balls, and given **N\_i** as the number of boxes with at least **i** balls:

1. Boxes with exactly **k** balls contribute **k** to the total.
2. There are **N\_k - N\_{k+1}** boxes with exactly **k** balls (where **N\_{r+1} = 0** ), since **N\_k** includes boxes with **k or more**, and **N\_{k+1}** includes those with **k+1 or more**.
3. Total balls = **0 × (N - N\_1) + 1 × (N\_1 - N\_2) + 2 × (N\_2 - N\_3) +... + r × N\_r**.

Expanding this sum simplifies to **N\_1 + N\_2 +... + N\_r**, confirming our observation.

### Conclusion

The setup involves **N** boxes, each holding up to **r** balls, with **N\_i** counting boxes having at least **i** balls for **i = 1 to r**. The total number of balls is elegantly captured by the sum **N\_1 + N\_2 +... + N\_r**, as each box’s contribution to this sum matches its number of balls. This relationship holds consistently, as shown through examples and reasoning, providing a clear illustration of how the variables interconnect.
