To determine the probability $p_1$  that Arjun wins when both he and Gukesh each toss three different fair coins, with Arjun winning if he has strictly more heads than Gukesh, we proceed as follows.

Since each coin is fair, the probability of landing heads or tails is $\frac{1}{2}$  , and all coin tosses are independent. For each person tossing three coins, the number of heads follows a binomial distribution with parameters $n = 3$  and $p = \frac{1}{2}$  . Let $X$  represent the number of heads Arjun gets, and $Y$  represent the number of heads Gukesh gets. Thus, $X \sim \text{Binomial}(3, \frac{1}{2})$  and $Y \sim \text{Binomial}(3, \frac{1}{2})$  , and $X$  and $Y$  are independent because their coin tosses are separate.

Arjun wins if $X > Y$  , so we need to compute $P(X > Y)$  . The possible values for both $X$  and $Y$  are 0, 1, 2, or 3. First, calculate the probability mass function for a binomial random variable with $n = 3$  and $p = \frac{1}{2}$  :

- $P(X = 0) = \binom{3}{0} \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = 1 \times \frac{1}{8} = \frac{1}{8}$
- $P(X = 1) = \binom{3}{1} \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = 3 \times \frac{1}{8} = \frac{3}{8}$
- $P(X = 2) = \binom{3}{2} \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = 3 \times \frac{1}{8} = \frac{3}{8}$
- $P(X = 3) = \binom{3}{3} \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = 1 \times \frac{1}{8} = \frac{1}{8}$

Since $X$  and $Y$  have the same distribution, $P(Y = k) = P(X = k)$  for $k = 0, 1, 2, 3$  . Because they are independent, the joint probability is:

$P(X = i, Y = j) = P(X = i) P(Y = j)$

We need $P(X > Y)$  , which is the sum of probabilities over all pairs $(i, j)$  where $i > j$  . List the winning pairs:

- If $X = 1$  , then $Y = 0$  ( $1 > 0$  )
- If $X = 2$  , then $Y = 0$  or 1 ( $2 > 0, 2 > 1$  )
- If $X = 3$  , then $Y = 0, 1,$  or 2 ( $3 > 0, 3 > 1, 3 > 2$  )

(Note: $X = 0$  contributes nothing since $0 > j$  is impossible for $j \geq 0$  .) Thus:

$P(X > Y) = P(X = 1) P(Y = 0) + P(X = 2) [P(Y = 0) + P(Y = 1)] + P(X = 3) [P(Y = 0) + P(Y = 1) + P(Y = 2)]$

Substitute the probabilities:

1. **$X = 1, Y = 0$** : $P(X = 1) P(Y = 0) = \frac{3}{8} \times \frac{1}{8} = \frac{3}{64}$
2. **$X = 2, Y = 0$  or 1**: $P(Y = 0) + P(Y = 1) = \frac{1}{8} + \frac{3}{8} = \frac{4}{8} = \frac{1}{2}$  $P(X = 2) [P(Y = 0) + P(Y = 1)] = \frac{3}{8} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{3}{16} = \frac{12}{64}$  (Since $\frac{3}{16} = \frac{3 \times 4}{16 \times 4} = \frac{12}{64}$  )
3. **$X = 3, Y = 0, 1,$  or 2**: $P(Y = 0) + P(Y = 1) + P(Y = 2) = \frac{1}{8} + \frac{3}{8} + \frac{3}{8} = \frac{7}{8}$  $P(X = 3) [P(Y = 0) + P(Y = 1) + P(Y = 2)] = \frac{1}{8} \times \frac{7}{8} = \frac{7}{64}$

Now, sum these probabilities with a common denominator of 64:

$P(X > Y) = \frac{3}{64} + \frac{12}{64} + \frac{7}{64} = \frac{3 + 12 + 7}{64} = \frac{22}{64}$

Simplify by dividing numerator and denominator by 2:

$\frac{22 \div 2}{64 \div 2} = \frac{11}{32}$

To confirm, use symmetry: since $X$  and $Y$  have identical distributions, $P(X > Y) = P(X < Y)$  , and:

$P(X > Y) + P(X = Y) + P(X < Y) = 1$  $2 P(X > Y) + P(X = Y) = 1$  $P(X > Y) = \frac{1 - P(X = Y)}{2}$

Compute $P(X = Y)$  :

$P(X = Y) = \sum_{k=0}^{3} P(X = k) P(Y = k) = \left(\frac{1}{8}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{3}{8}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{3}{8}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{1}{8}\right)^2$  $= \frac{1}{64} + \frac{9}{64} + \frac{9}{64} + \frac{1}{64} = \frac{20}{64} = \frac{5}{16}$

Then:

$P(X > Y) = \frac{1 - \frac{5}{16}}{2} = \frac{\frac{11}{16}}{2} = \frac{11}{32}$

Both methods agree, so $p_1 = \frac{11}{32}$  . Among the options—(a) $\frac{1}{3}$  , (b) $\frac{11}{32}$  , (c) $\frac{3}{8}$  , (d) $\frac{13}{32}$  —the correct answer is (b).

Thus, the probability $p_1$  that Arjun wins is:

$\frac{11}{32}$

3 / 3 could you explain this a bit better way

Sure, let’s dive into this problem step-by-step and find the probability that Arjun wins when he and Gukesh each toss three fair coins, with Arjun winning if he gets strictly more heads than Gukesh. I’ll explain it clearly and naturally, making it easy to follow.

---

### Understanding the Setup

Imagine Arjun and Gukesh each flipping three fair coins. A fair coin means it has a 50% chance of landing heads (H) and a 50% chance of landing tails (T). Since they each toss three coins, we’re interested in how many heads each person gets and whether Arjun’s count exceeds Gukesh’s.

- **Arjun’s heads**: Let’s call the number of heads Arjun gets $X$  .
- **Gukesh’s heads**: Let’s call the number of heads Gukesh gets $Y$  .

For three coin tosses, the possible number of heads for each person is 0, 1, 2, or 3. Our goal is to find the probability that $X > Y$  , meaning Arjun has more heads than Gukesh.

---

### Modeling the Coin Tosses

Since the coins are fair, each toss is independent, and the probability of heads is $\frac{1}{2}$  . The number of heads follows a **binomial distribution**:

- $X$  (Arjun’s heads) follows a binomial distribution with 3 trials and probability $\frac{1}{2}$  , written as $X \sim \text{Binomial}(3, \frac{1}{2})$  .
- $Y$  (Gukesh’s heads) is the same: $Y \sim \text{Binomial}(3, \frac{1}{2})$  .
- Their tosses are independent because Arjun’s coins don’t affect Gukesh’s, and vice versa.

The binomial formula gives us the probability of getting exactly $k$  heads in 3 tosses:

$P(X = k) = \binom{3}{k} \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^3$

where $\left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^3 = \frac{1}{8}$  , and $\binom{3}{k}$  is the number of ways to choose $k$  heads out of 3 tosses. Let’s calculate these probabilities:

- $P(X = 0) = \binom{3}{0} \cdot \frac{1}{8} = 1 \cdot \frac{1}{8} = \frac{1}{8}$  (all tails: TTT)
- $P(X = 1) = \binom{3}{1} \cdot \frac{1}{8} = 3 \cdot \frac{1}{8} = \frac{3}{8}$  (e.g., HTT, THT, TTH)
- $P(X = 2) = \binom{3}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{8} = 3 \cdot \frac{1}{8} = \frac{3}{8}$  (e.g., HHT, HTH, THH)
- $P(X = 3) = \binom{3}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{8} = 1 \cdot \frac{1}{8} = \frac{1}{8}$  (all heads: HHH)

The same probabilities apply to $Y$  since Gukesh’s situation is identical.

---

### Defining Arjun’s Winning Condition

Arjun wins if $X > Y$  . With $X$  and $Y$  ranging from 0 to 3, let’s list the possible pairs where Arjun has more heads:

- **$X = 1$** : $Y = 0$  (1 > 0)
- **$X = 2$** : $Y = 0$  (2 > 0) or $Y = 1$  (2 > 1)
- **$X = 3$** : $Y = 0$  (3 > 0), $Y = 1$  (3 > 1), or $Y = 2$  (3 > 2)

If $X = 0$  , Arjun gets 0 heads, and since $Y \geq 0$  , he can’t win (0 is not greater than 0 or more). So, we only consider $X = 1, 2, 3$  .

The total probability is the sum of the probabilities of these winning pairs:

$P(X > Y) = P(X=1, Y=0) + P(X=2, Y=0) + P(X=2, Y=1) + P(X=3, Y=0) + P(X=3, Y=1) + P(X=3, Y=2)$

---

### Calculating the Probability

Since $X$  and $Y$  are independent, the joint probability is the product of their individual probabilities:

$P(X = i, Y = j) = P(X = i) \cdot P(Y = j)$

Using the probabilities we calculated, let’s compute each term:

1. **$P(X = 1, Y = 0) = P(X = 1) \cdot P(Y = 0) = \frac{3}{8} \cdot \frac{1}{8} = \frac{3}{64}$**  
	(Arjun gets 1 head, Gukesh gets 0.)
2. **$P(X = 2, Y = 0) = \frac{3}{8} \cdot \frac{1}{8} = \frac{3}{64}$**  
	(Arjun gets 2 heads, Gukesh gets 0.)
3. **$P(X = 2, Y = 1) = \frac{3}{8} \cdot \frac{3}{8} = \frac{9}{64}$**  
	(Arjun gets 2 heads, Gukesh gets 1.)
4. **$P(X = 3, Y = 0) = \frac{1}{8} \cdot \frac{1}{8} = \frac{1}{64}$**  
	(Arjun gets 3 heads, Gukesh gets 0.)
5. **$P(X = 3, Y = 1) = \frac{1}{8} \cdot \frac{3}{8} = \frac{3}{64}$**  
	(Arjun gets 3 heads, Gukesh gets 1.)
6. **$P(X = 3, Y = 2) = \frac{1}{8} \cdot \frac{3}{8} = \frac{3}{64}$**  
	(Arjun gets 3 heads, Gukesh gets 2.)

Now, sum them up:

$P(X > Y) = \frac{3}{64} + \frac{3}{64} + \frac{9}{64} + \frac{1}{64} + \frac{3}{64} + \frac{3}{64}$

Add step-by-step:

- $\frac{3}{64} + \frac{3}{64} = \frac{6}{64}$
- $\frac{6}{64} + \frac{9}{64} = \frac{15}{64}$
- $\frac{15}{64} + \frac{1}{64} = \frac{16}{64}$
- $\frac{16}{64} + \frac{3}{64} = \frac{19}{64}$
- $\frac{19}{64} + \frac{3}{64} = \frac{22}{64}$

So, $P(X > Y) = \frac{22}{64}$  . Simplify by dividing by 2:

$\frac{22 \div 2}{64 \div 2} = \frac{11}{32}$

---

### Alternative Approach: Using Symmetry

Since $X$  and $Y$  have the same distribution, the game is symmetric. There are three possible outcomes:

- $X > Y$  (Arjun wins)
- $X < Y$  (Gukesh has more heads)
- $X = Y$  (a tie)

The total probability is 1:

$P(X > Y) + P(X = Y) + P(X < Y) = 1$

Because $X$  and $Y$  are identically distributed, $P(X > Y) = P(X < Y)$  . Let’s call $P(X > Y) = p$  . Then:

$p + P(X = Y) + p = 1$

$2p + P(X = Y) = 1$

$p = \frac{1 - P(X = Y)}{2}$

Now, calculate $P(X = Y)$  , the probability they get the same number of heads:

$P(X = Y) = P(X=0, Y=0) + P(X=1, Y=1) + P(X=2, Y=2) + P(X=3, Y=3)$

$= \left( \frac{1}{8} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{3}{8} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{3}{8} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{1}{8} \right)^2$

$= \frac{1}{64} + \frac{9}{64} + \frac{9}{64} + \frac{1}{64} = \frac{1 + 9 + 9 + 1}{64} = \frac{20}{64} = \frac{5}{16}$

Then:

$P(X > Y) = \frac{1 - \frac{5}{16}}{2} = \frac{\frac{16}{16} - \frac{5}{16}}{2} = \frac{\frac{11}{16}}{2} = \frac{11}{32}$

This matches our earlier result!

### Final Answer

The probability that Arjun wins is $\frac{11}{32}$  . This makes sense: out of all possible outcomes, considering ties and symmetry, Arjun wins slightly more than a third of the time when he needs to beat Gukesh outright. The options provided— $\frac{1}{3}$  , $\frac{11}{32}$  , $\frac{3}{8}$  , $\frac{13}{32}$  —point to $\frac{11}{32}$  as the correct choice.

I mistakenly selected 3/8, how could have I avoided that?

To answer your query about how you could have avoided mistakenly selecting $\frac{3}{8}$  when the correct answer is $\frac{11}{32}$  , let’s walk through the problem and identify where the error might have occurred, then provide clear strategies to prevent it. The scenario involves Arjun and Gukesh each tossing three fair coins, with Arjun winning if he gets more heads than Gukesh. We need to find the probability of this event and understand how to compute it accurately.

### Understanding the Problem

Since each coin is fair (probability of heads = $\frac{1}{2}$  ), the number of heads Arjun gets (let’s call it $X$  ) and Gukesh gets (let’s call it $Y$  ) follows a binomial distribution with $n = 3$  trials and $p = \frac{1}{2}$  . There are 8 possible outcomes for each (since $2^3 = 8$  ), and $X$  and $Y$  are independent. The probabilities for each number of heads are:

- $P(X = 0) = \binom{3}{0} \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^3 = \frac{1}{8}$
- $P(X = 1) = \binom{3}{1} \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^3 = \frac{3}{8}$
- $P(X = 2) = \binom{3}{2} \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^3 = \frac{3}{8}$
- $P(X = 3) = \binom{3}{3} \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^3 = \frac{1}{8}$

The same applies to $Y$  . We need $P(X > Y)$  , the probability that Arjun has strictly more heads than Gukesh.

### Possible Source of the Mistake

You selected $\frac{3}{8}$  , which suggests a misstep in the calculation. A likely error is confusing the winning condition with a simpler probability, such as:

- **Calculating $P(X = 2)$** : The probability that Arjun gets exactly 2 heads is $\frac{3}{8}$  . You might have thought this represents the winning probability, but it doesn’t account for Gukesh’s heads. For example, if Gukesh also gets 2 or 3 heads, Arjun doesn’t win.
- **Partial Scenarios**: You might have considered only some winning cases (e.g., Arjun gets 2 heads and Gukesh gets 0 or 1) and stopped there, missing other cases like Arjun getting 1 head and Gukesh getting 0.

Since $\frac{3}{8} = 0.375$  is close to $\frac{11}{32} \approx 0.34375$  , it’s also possible you approximated or miscounted outcomes.

### Correct Calculation

Let’s compute $P(X > Y)$  correctly using two reliable methods to see what you should have done:

#### Method 1: Conditional Probability

Consider all possible values of $Y$  (Gukesh’s heads) and calculate the probability that $X > Y$  :

- **$Y = 0$** : $P(Y = 0) = \frac{1}{8}$  , $P(X > 0) = P(X = 1) + P(X = 2) + P(X = 3) = \frac{3}{8} + \frac{3}{8} + \frac{1}{8} = \frac{7}{8}$ 
	- Contribution: $\frac{1}{8} \cdot \frac{7}{8} = \frac{7}{64}$
- **$Y = 1$** : $P(Y = 1) = \frac{3}{8}$  , $P(X > 1) = P(X = 2) + P(X = 3) = \frac{3}{8} + \frac{1}{8} = \frac{4}{8} = \frac{1}{2}$ 
	- Contribution: $\frac{3}{8} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{3}{16} = \frac{12}{64}$
- **$Y = 2$** : $P(Y = 2) = \frac{3}{8}$  , $P(X > 2) = P(X = 3) = \frac{1}{8}$ 
	- Contribution: $\frac{3}{8} \cdot \frac{1}{8} = \frac{3}{64}$
- **$Y = 3$** : $P(Y = 3) = \frac{1}{8}$  , $P(X > 3) = 0$  (since $X \leq 3$  )
	- Contribution: $\frac{1}{8} \cdot 0 = 0$

Total:  
$P(X > Y) = \frac{7}{64} + \frac{12}{64} + \frac{3}{64} = \frac{22}{64} = \frac{11}{32}$

#### Method 2: Symmetry Approach

Since $X$  and $Y$  are identically distributed and independent, $P(X > Y) = P(Y > X)$  , and the total probability is: $P(X > Y) + P(X = Y) + P(Y > X) = 1$  $P(X > Y) = P(Y > X)$  $2 \cdot P(X > Y) + P(X = Y) = 1$

Calculate $P(X = Y)$  :

- $P(X = 0, Y = 0) = \frac{1}{8} \cdot \frac{1}{8} = \frac{1}{64}$
- $P(X = 1, Y = 1) = \frac{3}{8} \cdot \frac{3}{8} = \frac{9}{64}$
- $P(X = 2, Y = 2) = \frac{3}{8} \cdot \frac{3}{8} = \frac{9}{64}$
- $P(X = 3, Y = 3) = \frac{1}{8} \cdot \frac{1}{8} = \frac{1}{64}$

$P(X = Y) = \frac{1}{64} + \frac{9}{64} + \frac{9}{64} + \frac{1}{64} = \frac{20}{64} = \frac{5}{16}$

Then: $2 \cdot P(X > Y) + \frac{5}{16} = 1$  $2 \cdot P(X > Y) = 1 - \frac{5}{16} = \frac{11}{16}$  $P(X > Y) = \frac{11}{16} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{11}{32}$

Both methods confirm $P(X > Y) = \frac{11}{32}$  .

### How to Avoid the Mistake

Here are specific steps to prevent selecting $\frac{3}{8}$  :

1. **Define the Condition Clearly**: Recognize that Arjun wins only when $X > Y$  , not when he gets a specific number of heads (like 2). Avoid calculating probabilities like $P(X = 2) = \frac{3}{8}$  without comparing to $Y$  .
2. **Consider All Winning Scenarios**: Include every case where Arjun has more heads:
	- $X = 1, Y = 0$
	- $X = 2, Y = 0$  or 1
	- $X = 3, Y = 0, 1,$  or 2  
		Missing cases (e.g., $X = 1, Y = 0$  ) leads to errors.
3. **Use a Systematic Method**:
	- **Enumeration**: List all 64 outcomes (8 for Arjun × 8 for Gukesh) and count where $X > Y$  (22 cases), giving $\frac{22}{64} = \frac{11}{32}$  .
	- **Conditional Probability**: Compute as above, ensuring all terms are included and summed correctly.
	- **Symmetry**: Calculate $P(X = Y)$  accurately, then use $P(X > Y) = \frac{1 - P(X = Y)}{2}$  .
4. **Double-Check Calculations**: When adding fractions (e.g., $\frac{7}{64} + \frac{12}{64} + \frac{3}{64}$  ), verify the sum is $\frac{22}{64}$  , not $\frac{24}{64} = \frac{3}{8}$  , which could result from misaddition.
5. **Avoid Approximations Early**: Since $\frac{3}{8} \approx 0.375$  and $\frac{11}{32} \approx 0.34375$  are close, you might have rounded incorrectly. Work with exact fractions until the final step.
6. **Validate with Logic**: $\frac{3}{8}$  is too high intuitively for a symmetric game with ties. The tie probability $\frac{5}{16}$  leaves $\frac{11}{16}$  for wins, split equally, suggesting $\frac{11}{32}$  .

### Conclusion

You likely arrived at $\frac{3}{8}$  by calculating a probability like $P(X = 2)$  or miscounting winning outcomes. To avoid this, methodically account for all cases where $X > Y$  , use a structured approach (like the conditional or symmetry method), and verify your arithmetic. This ensures you reach $\frac{11}{32}$  consistently. https://grok.com/chat/4eb13872-cdee-4e53-bdb4-1482ef72a340
