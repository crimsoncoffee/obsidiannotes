n fact, by the time President Richard Nixon cut the dollar’s link to gold in 1971, terminating the last vestiges of the gold standard, US officials were quite sick of dollar dominance. The currency’s role had seemed a burden under the postwar monetary system agreed at Bretton Woods in 1944 — from the requirement to convert dollars into gold to the exchange rate rigidity that came with its central position — and now, amid the economic tumult of the 1970s, it seemed a danger. The administration, as one senior White House economist said at the time, needed to “eliminate” the dollar’s reserve currency role. In the heart of the dollar empire, policymakers developed plans to downgrade the greenback’s status and make it more like any other currency.

The dollar’s post-Bretton Woods triumph was a pivotal point in economic history. Ever since, the world has been on a dollar standard, for good and — according to Lula et al — for ill. Precisely what this dominance entails and the powers it grants are at the core of two new books. In *King Dollar*, Paul Blustein takes a broad look at the greenback, exploring its history, its competitors, and its use as a weapon of economic war. In *Chokepoints*, Edward Fishman zooms in on the geoeconomics, studying the growing role sanctions, largely underpinned by dollar dominance, have played in US foreign policy.
