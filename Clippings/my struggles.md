I’m 20. Currently pursuing B.Tech in CSE from a not-so-great college in Pune. But honestly, I came here not for academics, but for survival. After several S attempts, this was my last shot...to breathe freely in a new city.

I come from a struggling family, financially and emotionally. Things at home were toxic, and every penny spent was questioned like an interrogation. So, I left. And as soon as I entered Pune, I knew one thing:I had to fend for myself.

I focused on my skills. I’ve always tried to build them, honestly. I started side hustles, did freelance work, built projects, and even began writing a research paper on my own. Then, I found a tuition opportunity through UrbanPro.

It took 3 months to find it. The tuition was for ₹10,000. But the number of hours and energy I put into that one child was worth far more. I taught her even on weekends, guided her beyond academics, and even tried counselling her. She eventually admitted she had no interest in studies, only in sports. I respected that, and then I began teaching her with all the fun possible ways I can teach through, but unfortunately she didn't performed well, and that was heart wrenching for me because I really put on my time and effort, inleft my classes for her, I sacrificed my sleep and my food for her. I used to teach her from 7 to 10, and at 9 the mess food timings were over, so I used to come back to my room and eat bread and butter. So as the result came, I decided to leave and ask for my pay, guess what. They ghosted me and confronted me saying "we won't pay you, do whatever you want to do", I, didn't do anything then. Why? Because I didn't wanted to involve myself in something that could cause me trouble becauss they were from a rich background. And if you know what I'm trying to say, then that's the only reason I left without saying anything.

I had no one to back me up, so I quietly stepped away. Alone and broke.

Now I’m at a point again where I’m struggling to find another tuition. Meanwhile, I need to pay my hostel and college fees. I asked my parents,they said they can only help after June.

But it’s not just the money. It’s the shame. The disrespect. The way authorities treat you when you can't pay on time. It eats at your dignity.

Right now, it’s been 2 weeks and 3 days that I haven’t eaten lunch. I survive on bread, butter, and water for dinner. I even considered working at KFC, Subway, McD,anywhere. I had to skip buying basic girl essentials because I had no money.

And my parents? They just said, “She’s earning on her own now, she’ll manage.”

No. I’m not managing. I’m barely breathing.

I haven’t given up hope,but I’ve lost the energy to keep hope alive. My body is tired. My mind is bruised. The authorities may take action against me soon, and I have nothing to offer in return. No money. No support. No one to cry to.

Just me. My poor health. My pain. And now, you,an anonymous stranger who chose to read this.

Friends? They mocked me. Told me: "shakal ki to acchi hai, escort join Krle kahi se to paisa mil hi jayega", "ye dekho garseb aagyi, fees pay krdi ki abhi bhi nhi ki"..Are they friends?

Relationships? Abusive. Toxic. Manipulative.

I came here to say,I have no one to talk to. No one to listen. No hand to hold. Just these words, and this platform.

So thank you. If you read this, thank you for being here. Even if it’s just a silent presence.

> You're really strong. No matter what anyone says, you really are trying your best, and if not, anyone else, just this random stranger from the internet, I'm proud of you. You are pushing through, doing all that you can. It's not easy, you are willing to face it all, it's heroic. No matter what anyone says, you keep pushing, and that's amazing.
> 
> Your friends are not supposed to tear you down, they're supposed to push you up. There's no point in even confronting them, they're long gone. It's horrifying how someone could even say that; it honestly shows how low in character they are. They don't deserve you, bhai.
> 
> You've gone through a lot, still are, and the last thing you need more is your surroundings to push you down. Remember. No matter what. Remember who the fuck you are. Remember all the things you have gone through. Think of all the things you have pushed through all by yourself, and tell yourself that it's not easy. It's not easy to go through things you have gone through. I'm proud of you.
> 
> Kitna bhi, you might think that you don't have anyone, anybody to hold onto. Fuck it. At least you have yourself. You have been there with yourself since day 1. Who else do you need? We often tend to disregard ourselves self but bhai we are the only person we need to survive. No matter what. Hold yourself close. Appreciate yourself. More than what other people say, focus on yourself. It's YOUR life. YOU govern it. Stay strong. Stay proud. Things will work out. You're amazing. Super ducking strong. Don't you dare forget that. Hold your hand if nobody else would. At least you have you. And thats fucking amazing.
> 
> Always. ALWAYS remember who the fuck you are. Good luck <3
