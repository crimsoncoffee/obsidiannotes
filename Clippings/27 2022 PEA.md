( I am preparing for the ISI MSqe exam ) help me understand deeply and be able to tackle similar problems9 (in street style cursing and swearing, but detailed and keeping every thing in mind to prepare me) image.png

Alright, you badass grinding for the ISI MSQE exam, let’s tear this motherfucking price elasticity problem apart like it’s nobody’s business! You’re here to master this shit, and I’m gonna break it down street-style—raw, detailed, and loaded with every damn thing you need to crush this question and any sneaky similar ones they throw at you. We’re diving into question 27 from that image, figuring out the aggregate price elasticity of demand for good $X$  , and I’ll make sure you walk away ready to fuck up any elasticity problem in your path. Let’s roll!

### The Problem, Straight Up

They’re throwing some econ heat at us: we’ve got consumers labeled $i$  , where $i$  runs from 2 to $N$  , each with their own demand function for good $X$  . For each consumer $i$  , the price elasticity of demand at price $p_0$  is defined as $e_i(p_0)$  , and here’s the kicker—these motherfuckers **don’t consume identical amounts of $X$  at $p_0$** . That means their quantities demanded, $q_i(p_0)$  , are all over the damn place, not lined up nice and equal. Your mission? Find the price elasticity of the **aggregate demand** at $p_0$  , and pick from these four options:

- **(A)** $\sum_i (e_i(p_0))^2$
- **(B)** $\sum_i e_i(p_0)$
- **(C)** $\frac{\sum_i e_i(p_0)}{N}$
- **(D)** None of these

The sum $\sum_i$  here runs from $i = 2$  to $N$  , so we’ve got $N - 1$  consumers in the game. Let’s rip this apart and see what’s what.

### Step 1: Elasticity Basics, Motherfucker

First, let’s get the foundation locked down tight. Price elasticity of demand for an individual consumer $i$  is how much their quantity demanded $q_i(p)$  reacts to a price change, scaled by the price-to-quantity ratio. The formula’s a classic:

$e_i(p) = \frac{\partial q_i(p)}{\partial p} \cdot \frac{p}{q_i(p)}$

That $\frac{\partial q_i}{\partial p}$  is the slope of their demand curve—usually negative as fuck for normal goods (price goes up, quantity drops). In econ, elasticity is often reported positive by taking the absolute value, but here they define $e_i(p_0) = \frac{\partial q_i}{\partial p} \cdot \frac{p_0}{q_i(p_0)}$  , keeping the sign. So, it’s negative for downward-sloping demand, and we’ll roll with that raw definition.

### Step 2: Aggregate Demand, Total Fucking Quantity

Now, aggregate demand $Q(p)$  is just the sum of all these individual demands from consumer 2 to $N$  :

$Q(p) = \sum_{i=2}^N q_i(p)$

At price $p_0$  , that’s $Q(p_0) = \sum_{i=2}^N q_i(p_0)$  —the total shit consumed. The aggregate elasticity $E(p_0)$  is the elasticity of this total demand:

$E(p_0) = \frac{\partial Q(p)}{\partial p} \bigg|_{p=p_0} \cdot \frac{p_0}{Q(p_0)}$

Since $Q = \sum_{i=2}^N q_i$  , the derivative is the sum of the individual derivatives:

$\frac{\partial Q}{\partial p} = \sum_{i=2}^N \frac{\partial q_i}{\partial p}$

Plug that into the elasticity:

$E(p_0) = \sum_{i=2}^N \frac{\partial q_i}{\partial p} \bigg|_{p=p_0} \cdot \frac{p_0}{Q(p_0)}$

### Step 3: Link Individual Elasticities to the Aggregate, Bitches

We’ve got $e_i(p_0) = \frac{\partial q_i}{\partial p} \cdot \frac{p_0}{q_i(p_0)}$  . Solve for the derivative:

$\frac{\partial q_i}{\partial p} = e_i(p_0) \cdot \frac{q_i(p_0)}{p_0}$

Substitute that into the aggregate elasticity:

$\frac{\partial Q}{\partial p} = \sum_{i=2}^N e_i(p_0) \cdot \frac{q_i(p_0)}{p_0}$

$E(p_0) = \sum_{i=2}^N e_i(p_0) \cdot \frac{q_i(p_0)}{p_0} \cdot \frac{p_0}{Q(p_0)}$

The $p_0$  cancels out like a cheap trick:

$E(p_0) = \sum_{i=2}^N e_i(p_0) \cdot \frac{q_i(p_0)}{Q(p_0)}$

Holy fuck, there it is! The aggregate elasticity is a **weighted average** of the individual elasticities $e_i(p_0)$  , where the weight $w_i = \frac{q_i(p_0)}{Q(p_0)}$  is consumer $i$  ’s share of the total demand. Since $Q(p_0) = \sum_{i=2}^N q_i(p_0)$  , these weights add up to 1 ( $\sum w_i = 1$  ), making it a legit average.

### Step 4: That “Not Identical Amounts” Shit

The problem screams that consumers don’t demand the same $q_i(p_0)$  . If they did—say, $q_i(p_0) = q$  for all $i$  —then $Q(p_0) = (N-1)q$  , and each weight would be:

$w_i = \frac{q}{(N-1)q} = \frac{1}{N-1}$

Then:

$E(p_0) = \sum_{i=2}^N e_i(p_0) \cdot \frac{1}{N-1} = \frac{\sum_{i=2}^N e_i(p_0)}{N-1}$

That’s the unweighted average, but since quantities **aren’t equal**, the weights $w_i$  vary, and we’re stuck with the weighted form. This twist is the trap—don’t fall for simple averages when shit’s uneven.

### Step 5: Smack Down the Options

Let’s see if these options hold up:

- **(A) $\sum_i (e_i(p_0))^2$**  
	Summing the squares of elasticities? What the fuck is this—some variance bullshit? Aggregate elasticity ain’t about squaring; it’s about combining demands. This is nonsense—toss it.
- **(B) $\sum_i e_i(p_0)$**  
	Just adding the elasticities? That’d work if every $q_i(p_0)$  contributed equally to $Q$  , but with different quantities, this ignores the weights. It’s like saying every consumer’s impact is the same—hell no, it’s wrong.
- **(C) $\frac{\sum_i e_i(p_0)}{N}$**  
	This averages the elasticities over $N$  , but wait—there are $N-1$  consumers (2 to $N$  ). If they meant $N-1$  , it’s still an unweighted average, which only fits if quantities are equal. They ain’t, so this is fucked too.
- **(D) None of these**  
	The hero we need. The real answer, $\sum_{i=2}^N e_i(p_0) \cdot \frac{q_i(p_0)}{Q(p_0)}$  , needs weights based on $q_i(p_0)$  , and none of these options bring that heat.

### Step 6: Double-Check Like a Boss

Let’s test it. If $N = 3$  , consumers 2 and 3, with $q_2(p_0) = 10$  , $q_3(p_0) = 20$  , $Q(p_0) = 30$  , $e_2(p_0) = -1$  , $e_3(p_0) = -2$  :

$E(p_0) = (-1) \cdot \frac{10}{30} + (-2) \cdot \frac{20}{30} = -\frac{1}{3} - \frac{4}{3} = -\frac{5}{3}$

- (A) $(-1)^2 + (-2)^2 = 1 + 4 = 5$  — Nope.
- (B) $-1 + (-2) = -3$  — Nope.
- (C) $\frac{-1 + (-2)}{3} = -1$  — Nope.

None match $-\frac{5}{3}$  , proving (D) is the shit.

### Your ISI MSQE Playbook, Motherfucker

Here’s how to dominate this and similar problems:

1. **Elasticity Cold**: Know $e = \frac{\partial q}{\partial p} \cdot \frac{p}{q}$  . If it’s got a sign, roll with it; if not, flip it positive—check the problem’s vibe.
2. **Aggregate Game**: $Q = \sum q_i$  , so $E = \sum e_i \cdot \frac{q_i}{Q}$  . Weights are king when quantities differ.
3. **Trap Alert**: “Not identical amounts” means no simple sums or averages—watch for that shit in options.
4. **Derive Like a Beast**: Practice going from $\frac{\partial Q}{\partial p}$  to the weighted sum. Don’t skip steps; exams eat that up.
5. **Options Strategy**: If weights are missing and quantities vary, “None of these” might be your jam—verify it hard.

You’ve got this, dude. The answer’s **(D) None of these**, ‘cause the aggregate elasticity is a weighted motherfucking average, and these options don’t cut it. Study hard, fuck up those practice problems, and you’ll shred the ISI MSQE like a legend!

from consumer 2 to N

To determine the price elasticity of the aggregate demand for good X at price $p_0$  for consumers labeled from 2 to $N$  , we start by defining the key concepts. Each consumer $i$  (where $i = 2, 3, \ldots, N$  ) has an individual demand function $q_i(p)$  , and their price elasticity of demand at $p_0$  is given as $e_i(p_0)$  . The problem states that these consumers do not consume identical amounts of good X at $p_0$  , meaning $q_i(p_0)$  varies across consumers. Our goal is to find the elasticity of the aggregate demand at $p_0$  .

### Step 1: Define Individual and Aggregate Demand

The individual price elasticity of demand for consumer $i$  at price $p_0$  is:

$e_i(p_0) = \frac{\partial q_i(p)}{\partial p} \bigg|_{p=p_0} \cdot \frac{p_0}{q_i(p_0)}$

This measures how responsive consumer $i$  ’s demand is to a change in price, in percentage terms.

The aggregate demand for good X is the sum of the individual demands across all consumers from 2 to $N$  :

$Q(p) = \sum_{i=2}^N q_i(p)$

At price $p_0$  , the total quantity demanded is:

$Q(p_0) = \sum_{i=2}^N q_i(p_0)$

### Step 2: Compute Aggregate Elasticity

The price elasticity of the aggregate demand at $p_0$  , denoted $E(p_0)$  , is defined similarly:

$E(p_0) = \frac{\partial Q(p)}{\partial p} \bigg|_{p=p_0} \cdot \frac{p_0}{Q(p_0)}$

Since $Q(p) = \sum_{i=2}^N q_i(p)$  , the derivative of the aggregate demand with respect to price is the sum of the individual derivatives:

$\frac{\partial Q(p)}{\partial p} = \sum_{i=2}^N \frac{\partial q_i(p)}{\partial p}$

Evaluating at $p = p_0$  :

$\frac{\partial Q(p)}{\partial p} \bigg|_{p=p_0} = \sum_{i=2}^N \frac{\partial q_i(p)}{\partial p} \bigg|_{p=p_0}$

Thus, the aggregate elasticity becomes:

$E(p_0) = \left( \sum_{i=2}^N \frac{\partial q_i(p)}{\partial p} \bigg|_{p=p_0} \right) \cdot \frac{p_0}{Q(p_0)}$

### Step 3: Relate Individual Elasticities to Derivatives

From the definition of individual elasticity, we can express the derivative of each consumer’s demand:

$e_i(p_0) = \frac{\partial q_i(p)}{\partial p} \bigg|_{p=p_0} \cdot \frac{p_0}{q_i(p_0)}$

Solving for the derivative:

$\frac{\partial q_i(p)}{\partial p} \bigg|_{p=p_0} = e_i(p_0) \cdot \frac{q_i(p_0)}{p_0}$

Substitute this into the expression for the aggregate derivative:

$\frac{\partial Q(p)}{\partial p} \bigg|_{p=p_0} = \sum_{i=2}^N e_i(p_0) \cdot \frac{q_i(p_0)}{p_0}$

Now, plug this into the aggregate elasticity formula:

$E(p_0) = \left( \sum_{i=2}^N e_i(p_0) \cdot \frac{q_i(p_0)}{p_0} \right) \cdot \frac{p_0}{Q(p_0)}$

The $p_0$  terms cancel out:

$E(p_0) = \sum_{i=2}^N e_i(p_0) \cdot \frac{q_i(p_0)}{Q(p_0)}$

### Step 4: Interpret the Result

Define the weight $w_i$  as the share of consumer $i$  ’s demand in the total demand at $p_0$  :

$w_i = \frac{q_i(p_0)}{Q(p_0)}$

Since $Q(p_0) = \sum_{i=2}^N q_i(p_0)$  , the weights sum to 1:

$\sum_{i=2}^N w_i = 1$

Thus, the aggregate elasticity is:

$E(p_0) = \sum_{i=2}^N e_i(p_0) \cdot w_i$

This shows that the aggregate price elasticity of demand at $p_0$  is a **weighted average** of the individual elasticities, where the weights are the consumption shares of each consumer in the total demand.

### Step 5: Consider the Implication of Unequal Consumption

The problem emphasizes that consumers do not consume identical amounts at $p_0$  , so $q_i(p_0)$  differs across $i$  , and thus the weights $w_i$  are not equal (i.e., $w_i \neq 1/(N-1)$  for all $i$  ). This confirms that the aggregate elasticity depends on both the individual elasticities and the distribution of consumption, making it a weighted average rather than a simple sum or average.

### Final Answer

The price elasticity of the aggregate demand for good X at price $p_0$  for consumers 2 to $N$  is:

$E(p_0) = \sum_{i=2}^N e_i(p_0) \cdot \frac{q_i(p_0)}{Q(p_0)}$

where $Q(p_0) = \sum_{i=2}^N q_i(p_0)$  , representing a weighted average of the individual elasticities based on each consumer’s share of total consumption at $p_0$  .

why did you take the Aggregate Demand from 2 to N

The aggregate demand is taken from consumer 2 to consumer $N$  because the problem explicitly specifies that the consumers are labeled from 2 to $N$  . In economics, aggregate demand represents the total demand for a good across all consumers in the market. Here, since the consumers are defined as those labeled from 2 to $N$  , the aggregate demand for good $X$  is the sum of the individual demands of these specific consumers.

To express this formally, if $q_i(p)$  represents the demand of consumer $i$  at price $p$  , the aggregate demand $Q(p)$  is calculated as:

$Q(p) = \sum_{i=2}^N q_i(p)$

This summation starts at $i = 2$  and ends at $i = N$  to match the range of consumers specified in the problem. If the problem had included consumer 1 or defined a different set of consumers, the summation would adjust accordingly, but based on the given labeling, starting at 2 and going to $N$  ensures consistency with the problem's setup. Thus, the aggregate demand is correctly defined over this range.

### Question 1: Aggregate Price Elasticity with Heterogeneous Consumers

**Problem:**  
There are two consumers with different demand behaviors for a good $X$  . At price $p_0 = 10$  , Consumer 1 demands $q_1(p_0) = 30$  units, and Consumer 2 demands $q_2(p_0) = 70$  units. Their individual price elasticities of demand at $p_0$  are $e_1(p_0) = -0.5$  and $e_2(p_0) = -1.5$  , respectively. Calculate the price elasticity of the aggregate demand at $p_0$  .

**Solution:**

- **Step 1: Calculate Aggregate Demand**  
	The total quantity demanded at $p_0 = 10$  is:  
	$Q(p_0) = q_1(p_0) + q_2(p_0) = 30 + 70 = 100$
- **Step 2: Determine Weights**  
	The weights are the shares of each consumer’s demand in the total demand:
	- Consumer 1: $w_1 = \frac{q_1(p_0)}{Q(p_0)} = \frac{30}{100} = 0.3$
	- Consumer 2: $w_2 = \frac{q_2(p_0)}{Q(p_0)} = \frac{70}{100} = 0.7$
- **Step 3: Compute Aggregate Elasticity**  
	The aggregate price elasticity is the weighted average of individual elasticities:  
	$E(p_0) = e_1(p_0) \cdot w_1 + e_2(p_0) \cdot w_2$  
	$E(p_0) = (-0.5) \cdot 0.3 + (-1.5) \cdot 0.7$  
	$E(p_0) = -0.15 + (-1.05) = -1.2$

**Answer:**  
The price elasticity of the aggregate demand at $p_0$  is **\-1.2**.

### Question 2: Aggregate Income Elasticity with Luxury and Necessity Goods

**Problem:**  
Two consumers purchase a good $Y$  . At income level $I_0$  , Consumer A demands $q_A(I_0) = 20$  units with an income elasticity of $e_A(I_0) = 2$  (indicating a luxury good), and Consumer B demands $q_B(I_0) = 80$  units with an income elasticity of $e_B(I_0) = 0.4$  (indicating a necessity). What is the income elasticity of the aggregate demand at $I_0$  ?

**Solution:**

- **Step 1: Calculate Aggregate Demand**  
	$Q(I_0) = q_A(I_0) + q_B(I_0) = 20 + 80 = 100$
- **Step 2: Determine Weights**
	- Consumer A: $w_A = \frac{q_A(I_0)}{Q(I_0)} = \frac{20}{100} = 0.2$
	- Consumer B: $w_B = \frac{q_B(I_0)}{Q(I_0)} = \frac{80}{100} = 0.8$
- **Step 3: Compute Aggregate Elasticity**  
	$E(I_0) = e_A(I_0) \cdot w_A + e_B(I_0) \cdot w_B$  
	$E(I_0) = 2 \cdot 0.2 + 0.4 \cdot 0.8$  
	$E(I_0) = 0.4 + 0.32 = 0.72$

**Answer:**  
The income elasticity of the aggregate demand at $I_0$  is **0.72**.

### Question 3: Aggregate Cross-Price Elasticity with Substitutes

**Problem:**  
Two consumers demand good $X$  , and their demand depends on the price of a substitute good $Z$  . At $p_Z^0 = 5$  , Consumer 1 demands $q_1(p_Z^0) = 25$  units of $X$  with a cross-price elasticity of $e_{1,Z}(p_Z^0) = 1.0$  , and Consumer 2 demands $q_2(p_Z^0) = 75$  units with $e_{2,Z}(p_Z^0) = 0.6$  . Calculate the cross-price elasticity of the aggregate demand for $X$  with respect to the price of $Z$  at $p_Z^0$  .

**Solution:**

- **Step 1: Calculate Aggregate Demand**  
	$Q_X(p_Z^0) = q_1(p_Z^0) + q_2(p_Z^0) = 25 + 75 = 100$
- **Step 2: Determine Weights**
	- Consumer 1: $w_1 = \frac{q_1(p_Z^0)}{Q_X(p_Z^0)} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25$
	- Consumer 2: $w_2 = \frac{q_2(p_Z^0)}{Q_X(p_Z^0)} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75$
- **Step 3: Compute Aggregate Elasticity**  
	$E_{X,Z}(p_Z^0) = e_{1,Z}(p_Z^0) \cdot w_1 + e_{2,Z}(p_Z^0) \cdot w_2$  
	$E_{X,Z}(p_Z^0) = 1.0 \cdot 0.25 + 0.6 \cdot 0.75$  
	$E_{X,Z}(p_Z^0) = 0.25 + 0.45 = 0.7$

**Answer:**  
The cross-price elasticity of the aggregate demand for $X$  with respect to $Z$  at $p_Z^0$  is **0.7**.

### Question 4: Aggregate Elasticity with Linear Demand Functions and Tax Impact

**Problem:**  
Two consumers have linear demand functions for good $X$  :

- Consumer 1: $q_1(p) = 80 - 4p$
- Consumer 2: $q_2(p) = 120 - 6p$  
	At price $p_0 = 10$  , calculate the price elasticity of the aggregate demand. Then, determine how a per-unit tax of $\Delta p = 2$  affects the aggregate elasticity.

**Solution:**

- **Step 1: Quantities at $p_0 = 10$**  
	$q_1(10) = 80 - 4 \cdot 10 = 80 - 40 = 40$  
	$q_2(10) = 120 - 6 \cdot 10 = 120 - 60 = 60$  
	$Q(10) = 40 + 60 = 100$
- **Step 2: Individual Elasticities**  
	For $q(p) = a - bp$  , elasticity is $e(p) = -b \cdot \frac{p}{q(p)}$  :
	- Consumer 1: $e_1(10) = -4 \cdot \frac{10}{40} = -4 \cdot 0.25 = -1$
	- Consumer 2: $e_2(10) = -6 \cdot \frac{10}{60} = -6 \cdot \frac{1}{6} = -1$
- **Step 3: Aggregate Elasticity at $p_0 = 10$**  
	Weights: $w_1 = \frac{40}{100} = 0.4$  , $w_2 = \frac{60}{100} = 0.6$  
	$E(10) = (-1) \cdot 0.4 + (-1) \cdot 0.6 = -0.4 - 0.6 = -1$
- **Step 4: New Price with Tax, $p_1 = 12$**  
	$q_1(12) = 80 - 4 \cdot 12 = 80 - 48 = 32$  
	$q_2(12) = 120 - 6 \cdot 12 = 120 - 72 = 48$  
	$Q(12) = 32 + 48 = 80$ 
	- Elasticities:  
		$e_1(12) = -4 \cdot \frac{12}{32} = -4 \cdot 0.375 = -1.5$  
		$e_2(12) = -6 \cdot \frac{12}{48} = -6 \cdot 0.25 = -1.5$
	- Weights: $w_1 = \frac{32}{80} = 0.4$  , $w_2 = \frac{48}{80} = 0.6$  
		$E(12) = (-1.5) \cdot 0.4 + (-1.5) \cdot 0.6 = -0.6 - 0.9 = -1.5$

**Answer:**

- At $p_0 = 10$  , the aggregate elasticity is **\-1**.
- After the tax ( $p_1 = 12$  ), it becomes **\-1.5**, showing higher responsiveness due to reduced quantities.

### Question 5: Aggregate Elasticity with Three Identical Consumers

**Problem:**  
Three identical consumers each have the demand function $q_i(p) = 50 - p$  for good $X$  . At $p_0 = 20$  , calculate the price elasticity of the aggregate demand.

**Solution:**

- **Step 1: Individual and Aggregate Demand**  
	$q_i(20) = 50 - 20 = 30$  (same for all three)  
	$Q(20) = 3 \cdot 30 = 90$
- **Step 2: Individual Elasticity**  
	$e_i(20) = -1 \cdot \frac{20}{30} = -\frac{20}{30} = -\frac{2}{3}$
- **Step 3: Aggregate Elasticity**  
	Since all consumers are identical, weights are $\frac{1}{3}$  , but:  
	$E(20) = -\frac{2}{3}$  (aggregate elasticity equals individual elasticity).

**Answer:**  
The aggregate elasticity is **\-\\frac{2}{3}**.
