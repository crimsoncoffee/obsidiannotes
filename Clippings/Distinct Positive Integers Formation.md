To determine the number of distinct positive integers that can be formed using the digits 0, 1, 2, and 4, where each digit is used at most once, we need to consider positive integers of all possible lengths: one-digit, two-digit, three-digit, and four-digit numbers. Since we have four distinct digits and each can be used at most once in a number, the maximum length is four digits. Additionally, because these are positive integers, the first digit cannot be 0. Let’s calculate the number of valid numbers for each length systematically.

### One-Digit Numbers

For a one-digit number, we select a single digit from the set {0, 1, 2, 4}. However, since the number must be a positive integer (i.e., greater than 0), we exclude 0. The possible digits are:

- 1
- 2
- 4

This gives us **3 one-digit numbers**.

### Two-Digit Numbers

For a two-digit number, we need two distinct digits, and the first digit cannot be 0. We can approach this by considering the first digit and then the second digit:

- **First digit**: Choose from {1, 2, 4} (since 0 is not allowed), giving 3 choices.
- **Second digit**: Choose from the remaining 3 digits (including 0, but excluding the first digit), giving 3 choices.

Calculate as follows:

- If the first digit is 1, the second digit can be 0, 2, or 4, forming: 10, 12, 14 (3 numbers).
- If the first digit is 2, the second digit can be 0, 1, or 4, forming: 20, 21, 24 (3 numbers).
- If the first digit is 4, the second digit can be 0, 1, or 2, forming: 40, 41, 42 (3 numbers).

Total two-digit numbers = 3 (first digit choices) × 3 (second digit choices) = **9 numbers**.

Alternatively, consider all pairs of distinct digits and their valid arrangements:

- Pairs without 0: {1, 2}, {1, 4}, {2, 4} (3 pairs). Each pair has 2 permutations (e.g., {1, 2} → 12, 21), all valid since neither starts with 0. Total = 3 × 2 = 6.
- Pairs with 0: {0, 1}, {0, 2}, {0, 4} (3 pairs). Each pair has 1 valid permutation (0 not first: 10, 20, 40). Total = 3 × 1 = 3.

Total = 6 + 3 = **9**, confirming the calculation.

### Three-Digit Numbers

For a three-digit number, we use three distinct digits from {0, 1, 2, 4}, and the first digit cannot be 0:

- **First digit**: Choose from {1, 2, 4}, giving 3 choices.
- **Second digit**: Choose from the remaining 3 digits, giving 3 choices.
- **Third digit**: Choose from the remaining 2 digits, giving 2 choices.

Total = 3 × 3 × 2 = **18 numbers**.

Alternatively, consider permutations of three digits from four, excluding those starting with 0:

- Total permutations of 3 digits = P(4, 3) = 4 × 3 × 2 = 24.
- Permutations starting with 0: Fix 0 first, then arrange the remaining 2 from 3 digits = 3 × 2 = 6.
- Valid numbers = 24 − 6 = 18.

Or by subsets:

- Subset without 0: {1, 2, 4}, permutations = 3! = 6.
- Subsets with 0: {0, 1, 2}, {0, 1, 4}, {0, 2, 4} (3 subsets). For each, valid permutations = 3! − 2! = 6 − 2 = 4 (e.g., {0, 1, 2} → 102, 120, 201, 210). Total = 3 × 4 = 12.
- Total = 6 + 12 = 18.

All methods yield **18 three-digit numbers**.

### Four-Digit Numbers

For a four-digit number, we use all four digits {0, 1, 2, 4} exactly once (since each digit is used at most once, and we have four positions):

- Total permutations = 4! = 24.
- Permutations starting with 0: 0 fixed first, remaining 3 digits in 3! = 6 ways.
- Valid numbers = 24 − 6 = **18 numbers**.

Alternatively:

- First digit: Choose from {1, 2, 4} (3 choices).
- Remaining three digits arranged in 3! = 6 ways.
- Total = 3 × 6 = 18.

This confirms **18 four-digit numbers**.

### Total Count

Add the numbers from each length:

- One-digit: 3
- Two-digit: 9
- Three-digit: 18
- Four-digit: 18

Total = 3 + 9 + 18 + 18 = 48.

### Verification

Since we have only four digits, numbers beyond four digits are impossible without repetition, which is not allowed. All numbers are distinct due to unique digit combinations and positions, and all are positive integers. The options are 48, 84, 64, and 36, and our total matches option (A) 48, reinforcing confidence in the solution.

Thus, the number of distinct positive integers that can be formed is **48**. https://grok.com/chat/e5e4a934-dc71-4d90-b50b-4dbb7c6ce4e5
