**WHO Declares Niger as the 1st Country in Africa to Eliminate Onchocerciasis**

**1st African country**

- Niger’s success marks the **2nd time** the country has eliminated a Neglected Tropical Disease (NTD), having been certified free of dracunculiasis (Guinea-worm disease) transmission in 2013.
- Niger joins **4 other** countries: Colombia (2013), Ecuador (2014), Mexico (2015) and Guatemala (2016) that have been verified by the WHO for eliminating onchocerciasis.
  
  **Note**: As of December 2024, 54 countries worldwide had successfully eliminated at least one NTD. WHO’s goal is to see 100 countries eliminate at least one NTD by 2030.  
  **Criteria for eliminating** **Onchocerciasis****:**  
  For a country to be declared free of human onchocerciasis, all endemic foci must demonstrate this evidence with **95%** statistical confidence before stopping Mass Drug Administration (MDA).  
  **What is Onchocerciasis?**  
  **i.**Onchocerciasis, or river blindness, is a parasitic disease caused by the **Onchocerca** **volvulus** parasite.  
  **ii.**The disease is transmitted to humans through the bites of infected **black flies**, mainly in riverine areas.  
  **iii.**Onchocerciasis is the 2nd leading infectious cause of blindness worldwide, after trachoma. It is also known to cause skin problems and can lead to permanent disability.  
  **iv.** Rural populations in sub-Saharan Africa and Yemen are most affected, though smaller endemic areas exist in parts of Latin America.  
  **Key Achievements of Niger:**  
  **i.WHO** **Onchocerciasis Control Programme** **(OCP)**: From 1976 to 1989, Niger implemented vector control measures, including insecticide spraying, which significantly reduced transmission.  
  **ii.Mass** **Drug Administration (MDA)**: In 2008, Niger launched MDA using ivermectin and albendazole, donated by Merck, Sharpe & Dohme (MSD), to combat both onchocerciasis and lymphatic filariasis (LF).  
  **iii.**In 2014 after stopping LF MDA in most areas, confirmed that combined efforts of medicine distribution and vector control eliminated transmission, reducing prevalence from 60% to just **0.02%.**
