Last week Donald Trump announced that imports from China would face tariffs of 10% on top of existing duties. On Monday China’s response came into effect. A range of American energy exports face a 15% levy; other products, including lorries and agricultural machinery, will have a 10% charge. The [package of counter-measures](https://www.economist.com/international/2025/02/06/xi-jinping-swings-his-assassins-mace-of-economic-warfare) also includes export controls on rare metals, restrictions on two American companies operating in China and an antitrust investigation of Google, an American tech giant.

China’s tariffs are temperate: whereas Mr Trump’s salvo applies to $450bn of Chinese imports each year, China’s response targets $20bn-worth of goods. But it hints at how Xi Jinping, China’s ruler, plans to parry Mr Trump. The industries singled out for tariffs support between 400,000 and 700,000 American jobs, according to Brookings, a think-tank. Those jobs are mainly in rustbelt counties in the Midwest, Mr Trump’s political heartland.
