Below is a detailed, step-by-step reasoning for this logic problem. The statement we are given is:

> “ $P, Q, R$ are statements such that **if $P$ is true** then **at least one** of the following holds: (i) $Q$ is true, or (ii) $R$ is not true.”

In logical notation, we can restate that as:

$$
P \;\Longrightarrow\; \bigl( Q \;\text{OR}\; \lnot R \bigr).
$$

We want to test which of the following conclusions (A), (B), or (C) necessarily follows from that premise (or if none do):

1. **(A)** If both $P$ **and** $Q$ are true, then $R$ is true.
2. **(B)** If both $Q$ **and** $R$ are true, then $P$ is true.
3. **(C)** If both $P$ **and** $R$ are true, then $Q$ is true.
4. **(D)** None of the above are correct.

## Restating the premise in standard form

- The premise “If $P$ is true then $Q$ is true or $R$ is not true” can be written as:
	$$
	P \implies (Q \lor \lnot R).
	$$
- In words, whenever $P$ holds, at least one of these must be the case: $Q$ is true, or $R$ is false.

A useful perspective:

- A statement of the form “ $P \implies (Q \lor \lnot R)$ ” means that if $P$ is ever *activated* (i.e., is true), we must **ensure** “ $Q$ or $\lnot R$ ” is also true. If $P$ is false, the implication is automatically satisfied, and we do not glean direct constraints from the premise about $Q$ or $R$ in that case.

---

## Evaluating each proposed conclusion

We now look at each candidate conclusion (A), (B), and (C) and check whether it follows from the premise. A standard way to analyze these implications is:

1. **Assume** the condition (e.g., “ $P$ and $Q$ are both true”).
2. **See** if this must force the desired statement (e.g., “ $R$ must be true”).

If, under the assumption, we see that the premise can still be satisfied *without* forcing the conclusion, then that conclusion is **not** entailed by the premise.

### (A) If both PP and QQ are true, then RR is true.

- **Claim**: $P \land Q \implies R$ .
- **Check**: Our premise says $P \implies (Q \lor \lnot R)$ . If $P$ is true, we need either $Q$ to be true or $\lnot R$ (i.e., “ $R$ is not true”) to be true.
- **But** suppose $P$ is true *and* $Q$ is true. Then the condition “ $Q \lor \lnot R$ ” is already satisfied by $Q$ alone—no additional requirement about $R$ arises. That is, with $Q$ being true, the premise is fulfilled regardless of whether $R$ is true or false.

Hence from “ $P$ and $Q$ ” being true, we **cannot** force $R$ to be true. The premise does not demand anything about $R$ in that scenario. Therefore:

$$
\text{(A) is NOT necessarily correct.}
$$

---

### (B) If both QQ and RR are true, then PP is true.

- **Claim**: $Q \land R \implies P$ .
- **Check**: The original premise $P \implies (Q \lor \lnot R)$ places a condition **only** on the case where $P$ is true. It does not say that if $Q$ and $R$ are both true, then $P$ must be true. For instance:
	- We could have $Q$ = True, $R$ = True, and $P$ = False.
	- If $P = \text{False}$ , the premise $P \implies (Q \lor \lnot R)$ is trivially satisfied (because an implication is automatically true when its antecedent $P$ is false).
	- So there is no contradiction in having $Q$ and $R$ both true while $P$ is false.

Thus, the premise does not force $P$ to be true if $Q$ and $R$ are both true. So:

$$
\text{(B) is NOT necessarily correct.}
$$

---

### (C) If both PP and RR are true, then QQ is true.

- **Claim**: $P \land R \implies Q$ .
- **Check**: Let’s apply our premise carefully:
	- The premise again is: $P \implies (Q \lor \lnot R)$ .
	- If $P$ is true, the statement “ $Q \lor \lnot R$ ” must hold.
	- Now, if $R$ is also true, then $\lnot R$ is **false**.
	- The only way to keep “ $Q \lor \lnot R$ ” true is for $Q$ to be true (since $\lnot R$ would be false).

Hence, whenever $P$ and $R$ are both true, $Q$ **must** be true to satisfy $P \implies (Q \lor \lnot R)$ . This means:

$$
\text{(C) IS necessarily correct.}
$$

---

## Conclusion

Only statement (C) follows logically from the premise $P \implies (Q \lor \lnot R)$ . Therefore, the correct choice is:

$$
\boxed{ \text{(C)} \quad \text{If both \(P\) and \(R\) are true, then \(Q\) is true.} }
$$

## Polya-style thoughts and problem-solving approaches

1. **Rewriting the premise**: Put “If $P$ then ( $Q$ or $\lnot R$ )” in a more standardized logical form. This step helps avoid confusion and clarifies how implications work.
2. **Checking each option**: Treat each proposed statement as its own implication and see if that implication always holds given the premise.
3. **Considering truth tables or direct logical reasoning**:
	- One way is to consider partial truth assignments: If $P$ is true, the premise demands a certain condition. If $P$ is false, the premise is automatically satisfied. Then test how that lines up with each claim (A), (B), (C).
	- Another way is to use logical equivalences. “ $P \implies (Q \lor \lnot R)$ ” is equivalent to “ $\lnot P \lor Q \lor \lnot R$ .” Then see which of (A), (B), (C) you can derive.
4. **Key insight**: In the statement $P \implies (Q \lor \lnot R)$ , whenever $P$ is true, we rely on $Q$ or $\lnot R$ being true. If in addition $R$ is true, the “ $\lnot R$ ” part is ruled out, so $Q$ must be true.

This direct reasoning shows why (C) must hold and why (A) and (B) do not. https://chatgpt.com/g/g-p-67f6fc49b80c8191a48547851da5720a-tomato/c/67f6fcbc-b328-8008-8488-a67456ee76eb
