To determine which total number of balls in the bag—170, 210, 250, or 194—cannot satisfy the given conditions, let’s carefully analyze the problem step by step.

The problem states that a bag contains colored balls, with at least 90% being red. Balls are drawn one by one, and their colors are noted. Specifically:

- Out of the first 50 balls drawn, 49 are red.
- Thereafter, 7 out of every 8 balls drawn are red.

Since the problem involves a finite number of balls and describes a specific sequence of draws, it’s reasonable to assume the drawing is without replacement (balls are removed once drawn) and continues until the bag is empty. We need to find which of the given totals violates the conditions.

### Step 1: Define Variables

- Let $N$  be the total number of balls in the bag.
- Let $R$  be the total number of red balls initially.
- Condition: At least 90% are red, so $R \geq 0.9N$  .

### Step 2: Analyze the Drawing Sequence

- **First 50 draws**: 49 balls are red, 1 is non-red.
- **Remaining draws**: After the first 50, there are $N - 50$  balls left. The problem states that “thereafter, 7 out of every 8 balls drawn are red,” suggesting that the remaining draws are grouped into sets of 8 balls, with each set containing exactly 7 red balls and 1 non-red ball.

For this to be possible, $N - 50$  (the number of remaining balls) must be a multiple of 8, allowing the remaining draws to be divided into complete groups of 8.

### Step 3: Check if N−50 N - 50 is a Multiple of 8

Calculate $N - 50$  for each option:

- $N = 170$  : $170 - 50 = 120$  , $120 \div 8 = 15$  , integer.
- $N = 210$  : $210 - 50 = 160$  , $160 \div 8 = 20$  , integer.
- $N = 250$  : $250 - 50 = 200$  , $200 \div 8 = 25$  , integer.
- $N = 194$  : $194 - 50 = 144$  , $144 \div 8 = 18$  , integer.

All options satisfy this requirement, so the remaining balls can be grouped into sets of 8.

### Step 4: Calculate the Number of Groups and Red Balls

- Number of groups of 8 after the first 50 draws: $K = \frac{N - 50}{8}$  .
- In each group of 8, there are 7 red balls.
- Total red balls in the remaining draws: $7 \times K = 7 \times \frac{N - 50}{8}$  .
- Total red balls drawn:
	- From the first 50: 49 red.
	- From the remaining: $7 \times \frac{N - 50}{8}$  .
- Thus, $R = 49 + 7 \times \frac{N - 50}{8}$  .
- Total balls: $N = 50 + 8K$  , which is consistent since $8K = N - 50$  .

Since all balls are drawn, $R$  is the exact number of red balls initially.

### Step 5: Verify the 90% Condition

The bag must have $R \geq 0.9N$  . Compute for each option:

- **$N = 170$** :
	- $K = \frac{170 - 50}{8} = \frac{120}{8} = 15$  .
	- $R = 49 + 7 \times 15 = 49 + 105 = 154$  .
	- $0.9 \times 170 = 153$  .
	- Check: $154 > 153$  , satisfies $R \geq 0.9N$  .
- **$N = 210$** :
	- $K = \frac{210 - 50}{8} = \frac{160}{8} = 20$  .
	- $R = 49 + 7 \times 20 = 49 + 140 = 189$  .
	- $0.9 \times 210 = 189$  .
	- Check: $189 \geq 189$  , satisfies $R \geq 0.9N$  .
- **$N = 250$** :
	- $K = \frac{250 - 50}{8} = \frac{200}{8} = 25$  .
	- $R = 49 + 7 \times 25 = 49 + 175 = 224$  .
	- $0.9 \times 250 = 225$  .
	- Check: $224 < 225$  , does not satisfy $R \geq 0.9N$  .
- **$N = 194$** :
	- $K = \frac{194 - 50}{8} = \frac{144}{8} = 18$  .
	- $R = 49 + 7 \times 18 = 49 + 126 = 175$  .
	- $0.9 \times 194 = 174.6$  .
	- Check: $175 > 174.6$  , satisfies $R \geq 0.9N$  .

### Step 6: Interpret the Results

- $N = 170$  : $R = 154$  , $154/170 \approx 0.9059 > 0.9$  , possible.
- $N = 210$  : $R = 189$  , $189/210 = 0.9$  , possible.
- $N = 250$  : $R = 224$  , $224/250 = 0.896 < 0.9$  , not possible.
- $N = 194$  : $R = 175$  , $175/194 \approx 0.9021 > 0.9$  , possible.

For $N = 250$  , the total red balls (224) is less than 90% of 250 (225), violating the condition that at least 90% of the balls are red.

### Step 7: Feasibility of the Sequence

Since drawing is without replacement, the sequence must be possible:

- After 50 draws: Remaining balls = $N - 50$  , red balls left = $R - 49 = 7K$  .
- Each group of 8 requires 7 red and 1 non-red.
- After $j$  groups: Remaining red = $7(K - j)$  , total remaining = $8(K - j)$  .
- Need $7(K - j) \geq 7$  for $j = 1$  to $K-1$  , which holds as $K \geq 15$  in all options.

The sequence is feasible for all $N$  where $R$  matches the total red balls drawn and satisfies $R \geq 0.9N$  .

### Conclusion

Only $N = 250$  results in $R < 0.9N$  (224 < 225), making it impossible to have at least 90% red balls. The other options satisfy all conditions.

Thus, the number of balls in the bag cannot be 250.
