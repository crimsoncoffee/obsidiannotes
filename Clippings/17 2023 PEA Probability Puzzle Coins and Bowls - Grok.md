Let’s dive into this probability puzzle with three bowls and some colorful coins. We have Bowl A with two red coins, Bowl B with two white coins, and Bowl C with one white coin and one red coin. The setup is simple: a bowl is picked at random—each with a probability of 1/3—and then a coin is chosen randomly from that bowl. We’re told that the coin picked is white, and our mission is to figure out the probability that the other coin in the same bowl is red. Let’s solve this step-by-step.

Since the chosen coin is white, Bowl A is immediately out of the picture—it only has red coins, so it can’t produce a white one. That leaves us with Bowl B and Bowl C as the possible sources. Our goal is to find the probability that, given a white coin was chosen, the other coin in its bowl is red. This feels like a classic conditional probability problem, so let’s define our events clearly:

- **W**: The event that the chosen coin is white.
- **R\_other**: The event that the other coin in the selected bowl is red.

We need to compute **P(R\_other | W)**, the probability of R\_other given W. Using the definition of conditional probability:

**P(R\_other | W) = P(R\_other and W) / P(W)**

### Step 1: Calculate P(W) – Probability of Choosing a White Coin

To find P(W), we consider all ways a white coin can be chosen across the bowls, accounting for the random selection of both the bowl and the coin.

- **Bowl A**: Two red coins. Probability of choosing Bowl A is 1/3, and the probability of picking a white coin from it is 0 (no white coins).  
	Contribution: **(1/3) × 0 = 0**.
- **Bowl B**: Two white coins. Probability of choosing Bowl B is 1/3, and the probability of picking a white coin is 1 (both coins are white).  
	Contribution: **(1/3) × 1 = 1/3**.
- **Bowl C**: One white coin, one red coin. Probability of choosing Bowl C is 1/3, and the probability of picking the white coin is 1/2 (one out of two coins).  
	Contribution: **(1/3) × (1/2) = 1/6**.

Total probability of W:  
**P(W) = 0 + 1/3 + 1/6 = 1/3 + 1/6 = 2/6 + 1/6 = 3/6 = 1/2**.

So, the probability of picking a white coin is **1/2**.

### Step 2: Calculate P(R\_other and W) – Joint Probability

Now, when does R\_other and W happen together? This occurs only when a white coin is chosen, and the other coin in that bowl is red. Let’s check each bowl:

- **Bowl A**: No white coins, so it contributes nothing (probability 0).
- **Bowl B**: Both coins are white. If a white coin is chosen (probability 1 when Bowl B is picked), the other coin is also white, not red. Contribution: **0**.
- **Bowl C**: One white, one red. If Bowl C is chosen (probability 1/3) and the white coin is picked (probability 1/2), the other coin is the red one.  
	Contribution: **(1/3) × (1/2) = 1/6**.

Thus, **P(R\_other and W) = 1/6**, since this scenario only happens with Bowl C when its white coin is selected.

### Step 3: Compute the Conditional Probability

Now, plug into the formula:  
**P(R\_other | W) = P(R\_other and W) / P(W) = (1/6) / (1/2) = 1/6 × 2/1 = 1/3**.

### Alternative Approach: Conditional on the Bowl Given W

Let’s try another angle to confirm. Define:

- **B**: Bowl B is chosen.
- **C**: Bowl C is chosen.

Given that a white coin was picked, it’s from either Bowl B or Bowl C. What’s the probability it’s from each, given W?

- **P(C | W) = P(W | C) × P(C) / P(W)**  
	P(W | C) = 1/2, P(C) = 1/3, P(W) = 1/2.  
	**P(C | W) = (1/2 × 1/3) / (1/2) = (1/6) / (1/2) = 1/3**.
- **P(B | W) = P(W | B) × P(B) / P(W)**  
	P(W | B) = 1, P(B) = 1/3, P(W) = 1/2.  
	**P(B | W) = (1 × 1/3) / (1/2) = (1/3) / (1/2) = 2/3**.

Check: **1/3 + 2/3 = 1**, which makes sense since A is impossible.

Now, R\_other is true only if the bowl is C (because in B, the other coin is white). So:  
**P(R\_other | W) = P(C | W) = 1/3**.

### Double-Check with Coin-Level Probabilities

Each bowl has two coins, and there are six coins total (two per bowl). Each coin has an equal chance of being picked: **(1/3) × (1/2) = 1/6**. The white coins are:

- Two in Bowl B (call them B1, B2).
- One in Bowl C (call it C1).

Total white coins: 3. P(W) = 3 × (1/6) = 1/2, consistent. Given W, each white coin is equally likely: **P(B1 | W) = P(B2 | W) = P(C1 | W) = (1/6) / (1/2) = 1/3**. Only C1 has a red partner, so **P(R\_other | W) = 1/3**.

### Conclusion

All methods—conditional probability, Bayes’ theorem, and coin counting—point to **1/3**. The multiple-choice options are (a) 1/3, (b) 1/4, (c) 1/2, (d) 1/6, and our answer matches (a).

**Final Answer: 1/3**

re-check

Since you've asked me to re-check, I assume you're referring to a probability problem we’ve discussed before. Based on the context, it seems to be about three bowls with coins, where we pick a bowl at random, select a coin, and given that it’s white, we need to determine the probability that the other coin in the same bowl is red. Let’s solve this step-by-step to ensure accuracy.

### Problem Setup

We have three bowls:

- **Bowl A**: 2 red coins
- **Bowl B**: 2 white coins
- **Bowl C**: 1 white coin and 1 red coin

The process is:

1. Select a bowl at random, so each bowl (A, B, C) has a probability of $\frac{1}{3}$  .
2. Pick a coin at random from the chosen bowl.
3. We’re told the coin picked is white.
4. We need to find the probability that the other coin in that same bowl is red.

### Step 1: Define the Events

Let’s define:

- $W$  : The event that the picked coin is white.
- $R_{\text{other}}$  : The event that the other coin in the same bowl is red.

We want $P(R_{\text{other}} | W)$  , the probability that the other coin is red given that the picked coin is white. Using conditional probability:

$P(R_{\text{other}} | W) = \frac{P(R_{\text{other}} \text{ and } W)}{P(W)}$

### Step 2: Analyze Possible Scenarios

Since the picked coin is white, let’s consider which bowls could produce a white coin:

- **Bowl A**: Contains only red coins, so the probability of picking a white coin is 0. This bowl can’t be the source.
- **Bowl B**: Contains 2 white coins, so the probability of picking a white coin is 1. The other coin is always white.
- **Bowl C**: Contains 1 white and 1 red coin, so the probability of picking the white coin is $\frac{1}{2}$  . If we pick the white coin, the other coin is red.

Thus, only Bowls B and C are relevant, as Bowl A is impossible given a white coin.

### Step 3: Compute P(W) P(W), the Probability of Picking a White Coin

Use the law of total probability, considering all bowls:

- Probability of picking Bowl A = $\frac{1}{3}$  , $P(W | \text{Bowl A}) = 0$
- Probability of picking Bowl B = $\frac{1}{3}$  , $P(W | \text{Bowl B}) = 1$
- Probability of picking Bowl C = $\frac{1}{3}$  , $P(W | \text{Bowl C}) = \frac{1}{2}$

$P(W) = P(W | \text{Bowl A}) \cdot P(\text{Bowl A}) + P(W | \text{Bowl B}) \cdot P(\text{Bowl B}) + P(W | \text{Bowl C}) \cdot P(\text{Bowl C})$

$P(W) = (0) \cdot \frac{1}{3} + (1) \cdot \frac{1}{3} + \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) \cdot \frac{1}{3} = 0 + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{6}$

Convert to a common denominator (6):

- $\frac{1}{3} = \frac{2}{6}$
- $\frac{1}{6} = \frac{1}{6}$

$P(W) = \frac{2}{6} + \frac{1}{6} = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}$

So, the total probability of picking a white coin is $\frac{1}{2}$  .

### Step 4: Compute P(Rother and W) P(R\_{\\text{other}} \\text{ and } W)

This is the probability that we pick a white coin *and* the other coin in the bowl is red. Check each bowl:

- **Bowl A**: Can’t pick a white coin, so contributes 0.
- **Bowl B**: Pick a white coin with probability 1, but the other coin is white, not red, so contributes 0 to $R_{\text{other}}$  .
- **Bowl C**: Pick the white coin with probability $\frac{1}{2}$  , and then the other coin is red. This is the only case where both events occur.

So, $P(R_{\text{other}} \text{ and } W)$  occurs only with Bowl C:

- Probability of picking Bowl C = $\frac{1}{3}$
- Probability of picking the white coin from Bowl C = $\frac{1}{2}$

$P(R_{\text{other}} \text{ and } W) = P(\text{Bowl C}) \cdot P(\text{pick white} | \text{Bowl C}) = \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{6}$

### Step 5: Calculate the Conditional Probability

Now plug into the formula:

$P(R_{\text{other}} | W) = \frac{P(R_{\text{other}} \text{ and } W)}{P(W)} = \frac{\frac{1}{6}}{\frac{1}{2}} = \frac{1}{6} \cdot 2 = \frac{1}{3}$

### Alternative Approach: Posterior Probabilities

Let’s confirm using the probabilities of each bowl given that we picked a white coin:

- $P(\text{Bowl B} | W) = \frac{P(W | \text{Bowl B}) \cdot P(\text{Bowl B})}{P(W)} = \frac{1 \cdot \frac{1}{3}}{\frac{1}{2}} = \frac{\frac{1}{3}}{\frac{1}{2}} = \frac{2}{3}$
- $P(\text{Bowl C} | W) = \frac{P(W | \text{Bowl C}) \cdot P(\text{Bowl C})}{P(W)} = \frac{\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{3}}{\frac{1}{2}} = \frac{\frac{1}{6}}{\frac{1}{2}} = \frac{1}{3}$

Now:

- If from Bowl B (probability $\frac{2}{3}$  ), the other coin is white, so $P(R_{\text{other}} | \text{Bowl B and } W) = 0$  .
- If from Bowl C (probability $\frac{1}{3}$  ), the other coin is red, so $P(R_{\text{other}} | \text{Bowl C and } W) = 1$  .

$P(R_{\text{other}} | W) = (0) \cdot \frac{2}{3} + (1) \cdot \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{3}$

### Intuitive Check

Imagine running the experiment 900 times:

- **Bowl A**: 300 times, 0 white coins.
- **Bowl B**: 300 times, all 300 yield a white coin, other coin is white.
- **Bowl C**: 300 times, 150 yield a white coin (other coin red), 150 yield a red coin.

Total white coin picks = 300 (B) + 150 (C) = 450. Times the other coin is red = 150 (from C). Probability = $\frac{150}{450} = \frac{1}{3}$  .

### Conclusion

After re-checking with multiple methods—conditional probability, posterior probabilities, and a simulation—all consistently yield $\frac{1}{3}$  . The answer is:

$\frac{1}{3}$ https://grok.com/chat/7fcb6b11-06be-4477-9b63-c72d14308c58
