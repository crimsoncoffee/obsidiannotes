Basel III introduced a countercyclical capital buffer (CCB) aimed at strengthening banks' defences against the build-up of systemic vulnerabilities.

ctivate or increase the required buffer and the communication of the related decisions. But the link between the credit-to-GDP gap and the capital buffer is not mechanical. Instead the framework allows for policymakers' judgment on how buffers are built up and released.

credit-to-GDP gap ("credit gap") is defined as the difference between the credit-to-GDP ratio and its long-term trend. Borio and Lowe (2002, 2004) first documented its property as a very useful early warning indicator (EWI) for banking crises.

The credit-to-GDP gap has received attention from academics and practitioners. Some have confirmed its usefulness as an indicator of financial vulnerabilities, but others have been more critical about its properties. The criticisms of the credit-to-GDP gap follow three main lines: (i) the credit gap is not a good guide for setting the buffer because it can lead to decisions that conflict with the CCB's objective; (ii) the credit gap is not the best EWI for banking crises, especially in the case of emerging market economies; and (iii) the credit gap has measurement problems.

The main objective of the CCB is to protect banks from the effects of the financial cycle (BCBS (2010, page 1)). The idea is to boost capital in periods when aggregate vulnerabilities are building up. Buffers accumulated in good times can then be released (ie used up) in bad times, helping to absorb losses.
