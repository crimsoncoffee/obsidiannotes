To address your query about the correlation coefficient, I'll walk you through finding the equation of the regression line of Y on X, given specific statistical parameters. Suppose we have two variables, X and Y, with the following information:

- Mean of X (μ\_X) = 100
- Standard deviation of X (σ\_X) = 10
- Mean of Y (μ\_Y) = 50
- Standard deviation of Y (σ\_Y) = 5
- Correlation coefficient between X and Y (r) = 0.8

We need to determine the equation of the regression line of Y on X, which predicts Y based on X and takes the form:

**Y = a + bX**

Here, **b** is the slope, and **a** is the intercept. Let’s calculate these step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate the Slope (b)

The slope of the regression line of Y on X is given by the formula:

**b = r × (σ\_Y / σ\_X)**

Where:

- **r** is the correlation coefficient,
- **σ\_Y** is the standard deviation of Y,
- **σ\_X** is the standard deviation of X.

Plugging in the given values:

**b = 0.8 × (5 / 10)**  
**b = 0.8 × 0.5**  
**b = 0.4**

So, the slope of the regression line is **0.4**. This means that for every unit increase in X, Y increases by 0.4 units, adjusted by the intercept.

### Step 2: Calculate the Intercept (a)

The regression line passes through the point defined by the means of X and Y, (μ\_X, μ\_Y). Using the regression equation Y = a + bX, substitute the means:

**μ\_Y = a + b × μ\_X**

Substitute the known values (μ\_Y = 50, b = 0.4, μ\_X = 100):

**50 = a + 0.4 × 100**  
**50 = a + 40**

Solve for **a**:

**a = 50 - 40**  
**a = 10**

So, the intercept is **10**.

### Step 3: Formulate the Regression Equation

With **a = 10** and **b = 0.4**, the equation of the regression line is:

**Y = 10 + 0.4X**

### Verification

Let’s verify using an alternative approach to ensure correctness. The regression line can also be expressed as:

**Y - μ\_Y = b (X - μ\_X)**

Expanding this:

**Y - 50 = 0.4 (X - 100)**  
**Y - 50 = 0.4X - 40**  
**Y = 0.4X - 40 + 50**  
**Y = 0.4X + 10**

This simplifies to:

**Y = 10 + 0.4X**

Both methods agree, confirming the equation is correct.

### Interpretation

The correlation coefficient of 0.8 indicates a strong positive relationship between X and Y. The slope **b = 0.4** reflects this relationship scaled by the standard deviations. For example, if X increases by one standard deviation (10 units), Y increases by:

**0.4 × 10 = 4 units**

Since one standard deviation of Y is 5 units, and r = 0.8, the increase in Y is 0.8 × 5 = 4 units, which matches our calculation, reinforcing consistency.

### Final Equation

The equation of the regression line of Y on X, incorporating the correlation coefficient and given parameters, is:

**Y = 10 + 0.4X**

explain all the results required to remeber for ISI msqe examination

To excel in the ISI MSQE (Master of Science in Quantitative Economics) examination, you need to master several key statistical and econometric results related to the relationships between variables. These concepts are foundational, frequently tested, and essential for both theoretical and applied questions. Below, I’ll explain each result in detail, including definitions, formulas, properties, and key points to remember.

### 1\. Correlation Coefficient (r)

The correlation coefficient measures the strength and direction of the **linear relationship** between two variables, $X$ and $Y$ .

- **Formula**:
	$$
	r = \frac{\text{Cov}(X, Y)}{\sigma_X \sigma_Y}
	$$
	 where $\text{Cov}(X, Y)$ is the covariance, and $\sigma_X$ and $\sigma_Y$ are the standard deviations of $X$ and $Y$ .
- **Range**:
	$$
	-1 \leq r \leq 1
	$$
	- $r = 1$ : Perfect positive linear relationship.
	- $r = -1$ : Perfect negative linear relationship.
	- $r = 0$ : No linear relationship (but non-linear relationships may still exist).
- **Key Properties**:
	- **Symmetric**: $r_{XY} = r_{YX}$ .
	- **Invariant to linear transformations**: If $Z = aX + b$ and $W = cY + d$ (where $a, c > 0$ ), then $r_{ZW} = r_{XY}$ .
- **Important Note**:  
	The correlation coefficient only captures **linear** associations. A value of $r = 0$ does not imply no relationship if the association is non-linear.

---

### 2\. Regression Line of Y on X

This describes the best linear prediction of $Y$ based on $X$ .

- **Equation**:
	$$
	Y = a + bX
	$$
	- **Slope (b)**:
		$$
		b = r \times \frac{\sigma_Y}{\sigma_X}
		$$
		 This shows how much $Y$ changes per unit change in $X$ .
	- **Intercept (a)**:
		$$
		a = \mu_Y - b \mu_X
		$$
		 where $\mu_X$ and $\mu_Y$ are the means of $X$ and $Y$ .
- **Alternative Form**:
	$$
	Y - \mu_Y = b (X - \mu_X)
	$$
	 This form highlights that the line passes through the point $(\mu_X, \mu_Y)$ .
- **Key Properties**:
	- The regression line minimizes the **sum of squared errors** in the $Y$ -direction.
	- It always passes through the mean point $(\mu_X, \mu_Y)$ .
- **Important Note**:  
	The slope $b$ depends on both the correlation and the relative variability of $Y$ and $X$ .

---

### 3\. Regression Line of X on Y

This is the reverse regression, predicting $X$ based on $Y$ .

- **Equation**:
	$$
	X = c + dY
	$$
	- **Slope (d)**:
		$$
		d = r \times \frac{\sigma_X}{\sigma_Y}
		$$
	- **Intercept (c)**:
		$$
		c = \mu_X - d \mu_Y
		$$
- **Key Properties**:
	- Minimizes the sum of squared errors in the $X$ -direction.
	- Passes through $(\mu_X, \mu_Y)$ .
- **Relationship Between Slopes**:  
	The slopes of the two regression lines are related by:
	$$
	b \times d = r^2
	$$
	 This links the two regression models via the correlation coefficient.

### 4\. Coefficient of Determination (R²)

The coefficient of determination measures how well the regression line explains the variability in $Y$ .

- **Formula**:
	$$
	R^2 = r^2
	$$
	 It is simply the square of the correlation coefficient.
- **Range**:
	$$
	0 \leq R^2 \leq 1
	$$
	- $R^2 = 1$ : The regression perfectly predicts $Y$ .
	- $R^2 = 0$ : No linear predictive power.
- **Interpretation**:  
	$R^2$ represents the **proportion of variance** in $Y$ explained by $X$ in the regression model.
- **Important Note**:  
	A high $R^2$ indicates a good fit for the linear model, but it only applies to the linear relationship.

---

### 5\. Properties of Covariance

Covariance measures how two variables vary together.

- **Formula**:
	$$
	\text{Cov}(X, Y) = E[(X - \mu_X)(Y - \mu_Y)]
	$$
	 Alternatively:
	$$
	\text{Cov}(X, Y) = E[XY] - \mu_X \mu_Y
	$$
- **Key Properties**:
	- $\text{Cov}(X, X) = \sigma_X^2$ (variance of $X$ ).
	- **Bilinear**:
		$$
		\text{Cov}(aX + b, cY + d) = ac \times \text{Cov}(X, Y)
		$$
		 (where $a, b, c, d$ are constants).
- **Important Note**:  
	Unlike correlation, covariance is **not standardized** and depends on the scale of the variables.

---

### 6\. Standard Error of Regression

This quantifies the accuracy of predictions from the regression line.

- **Formula**:
	$$
	\sigma_{Y|X} = \sigma_Y \sqrt{1 - r^2}
	$$
	 This is the standard deviation of $Y$ given a specific value of $X$ .
- **Interpretation**:
	- When $r^2 = 1$ , the standard error is 0 (perfect prediction).
	- When $r^2 = 0$ , the standard error equals $\sigma_Y$ (no predictive power).
- **Important Note**:  
	A smaller standard error indicates more precise predictions.

---

### 7\. Bivariate Normal Distribution

For variables $X$ and $Y$ following a bivariate normal distribution:

- **Key Results**:
	- The **conditional distribution** of $Y$ given $X$ (or $X$ given $Y$ ) is normal.
	- The regression line is **linear**.
	- The correlation coefficient $r$ fully describes the linear dependence.
	- If $r = 0$ , $X$ and $Y$ are **independent**.
- **Important Note**:  
	This independence property is unique to the bivariate normal case—zero correlation does not imply independence in general distributions.

---

### 8\. Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality

This inequality is critical for understanding the bounds of correlation.

- **Formula**:
	$$
	|\text{Cov}(X, Y)| \leq \sigma_X \sigma_Y
	$$
- **Implication**:  
	Since $r = \frac{\text{Cov}(X, Y)}{\sigma_X \sigma_Y}$ , this ensures:
	$$
	|r| \leq 1
	$$
- **Important Note**:  
	Equality holds when $X$ and $Y$ are perfectly linearly related.

---

### 9\. Transformations and Correlation

- **Linear Transformations**:  
	Correlation remains unchanged under linear transformations (e.g., $Z = aX + b$ ).
- **Non-linear Transformations**:  
	Correlation may change (e.g., if $Y = X^2$ , the correlation depends on $X$ ’s distribution).
- **Important Note**:  
	Always assess whether a transformation preserves the linear relationship.

---

### 10\. Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Correlation ≠ Causation**: A high $r$ does not mean $X$ causes $Y$ .
- **Non-linear Relationships**: A low $r$ might miss strong non-linear associations.
- **Outliers**: Correlation and regression are sensitive to extreme values.
- **Scale Misinterpretation**: The slope $b$ depends on the units of $X$ and $Y$ .
