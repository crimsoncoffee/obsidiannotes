To determine how much fish individual $A$  will optimally consume in the two periods, let’s carefully analyze the problem and solve it step-by-step.

### Problem Setup

- **Fish Supply**: $A$  can set up a net at $t = 0$  at no cost, yielding $f$  fish at $t = 1$  and nothing at $t = 2$  . Since the net is costless and the pond is his only source of fish, we assume he sets it up to obtain $f$  fish at $t = 1$  .
- **Consumption Periods**: $A$  can consume fish at $t = 1$  (denoted $c_1$  ) and $t = 2$  (denoted $c_2$  ), and he ceases to exist after $t = 2$  .
- **Storage**: He can store fish costlessly from $t = 1$  to $t = 2$  with no depreciation, meaning any fish not consumed at $t = 1$  can be consumed at $t = 2$  .
- **Utility**: His utility from consumption in each period is $u(c_t) = (c_t)^n$  , where $0 < n < 1$  , and he does not discount the future (i.e., he values utility at $t = 1$  and $t = 2$  equally).
- **Goal**: Maximize total utility $u(c_1) + u(c_2)$  over the two periods.

Since $A$  receives $f$  fish at $t = 1$  and can store any unconsumed amount for $t = 2$  , if he consumes $c_1$  at $t = 1$  , then $c_2 = f - c_1$  at $t = 2$  . He has no reason to leave fish unconsumed by $t = 2$  (as he ceases to exist afterward and utility is increasing), so all $f$  fish will be consumed, satisfying $c_1 + c_2 = f$  , with $0 \leq c_1 \leq f$  and $c_2 \geq 0$  .

### Optimization Problem

The total utility to maximize is:

$U = u(c_1) + u(c_2) = (c_1)^n + (f - c_1)^n$

We need to find the value of $c_1$  that maximizes this expression, subject to $0 \leq c_1 \leq f$  .

### Finding the Optimal Consumption

Since the utility function is continuous and defined over a closed interval, we can use calculus to find the maximum. Take the derivative of $U$  with respect to $c_1$  :

$\frac{dU}{dc_1} = n (c_1)^{n-1} + n (f - c_1)^{n-1} \cdot (-1) = n (c_1)^{n-1} - n (f - c_1)^{n-1}$

Set the derivative equal to zero to find critical points:

$n (c_1)^{n-1} - n (f - c_1)^{n-1} = 0$

$(c_1)^{n-1} = (f - c_1)^{n-1}$

Since $n - 1 < 0$  (because $0 < n < 1$  ), the function $x^{n-1}$  is decreasing for $x > 0$  . Thus, if $(c_1)^{n-1} = (f - c_1)^{n-1}$  , then:

$c_1 = f - c_1$

$2 c_1 = f$

$c_1 = \frac{f}{2}$

Then, $c_2 = f - c_1 = f - \frac{f}{2} = \frac{f}{2}$  . So, $c_1 = c_2 = \frac{f}{2}$  is a candidate for the optimum.

### Verifying the Maximum

Since $0 < n < 1$  , the utility function $u(c_t) = (c_t)^n$  is concave (its second derivative $u''(c_t) = n (n - 1) (c_t)^{n-2} < 0$  , as $n - 1 < 0$  ). The total utility $U = (c_1)^n + (f - c_1)^n$  is a sum of concave functions and is itself concave. For a concave function subject to a linear constraint like $c_1 + c_2 = f$  , the maximum often occurs where consumption is equalized if possible, which aligns with $c_1 = c_2$  .

To confirm, compute the second derivative:

$\frac{d^2 U}{dc_1^2} = n (n - 1) (c_1)^{n-2} + n (n - 1) (f - c_1)^{n-2} (-1)^2 = n (n - 1) (c_1)^{n-2} + n (n - 1) (f - c_1)^{n-2}$

Since $n (n - 1) < 0$  and $(c_1)^{n-2} > 0$  , $(f - c_1)^{n-2} > 0$  (assuming $0 < c_1 < f$  ), the second derivative is negative, indicating a maximum at $c_1 = \frac{f}{2}$  .

### Boundary Check

Evaluate the utility at the endpoints:

- If $c_1 = f$  , $c_2 = 0$  : $U = (f)^n + (0)^n = (f)^n$  (since $n > 0$  , $(0)^n = 0$  ).
- If $c_1 = 0$  , $c_2 = f$  : $U = (0)^n + (f)^n = (f)^n$  .
- If $c_1 = \frac{f}{2}$  , $c_2 = \frac{f}{2}$  : $U = \left(\frac{f}{2}\right)^n + \left(\frac{f}{2}\right)^n = 2 \left(\frac{f}{2}\right)^n = 2 \cdot \frac{f^n}{2^n} = 2^{1 - n} f^n$  .

Since $n < 1$  , $1 - n > 0$  , so $2^{1 - n} > 1$  , and thus $2^{1 - n} f^n > f^n$  . The utility at $c_1 = c_2 = \frac{f}{2}$  exceeds that at the boundaries, confirming it’s the maximum.

### Intuition

With no discounting, costless storage, and a concave utility function, $A$  prefers to smooth consumption across periods, equalizing $c_1$  and $c_2$  , which is possible since $c_1 + c_2 = f$  .

### Options Analysis

- **(A) Any division of $f$  fish is optimal**: Only true if $n = 1$  (linear utility), but $n < 1$  , so false.
- **(B) $c_1 = c_2 = \frac{f}{2}$** : Matches our solution.
- **(C) $c_1 = f, c_2 = 0$** : Suboptimal, as shown by lower utility.
- **(D) $c_1 = 0, c_2 = f$** : Suboptimal, as shown by lower utility.

### Final Answer

$A$  will optimally consume $c_1 = \frac{f}{2}$  at $t = 1$  and $c_2 = \frac{f}{2}$  at $t = 2$  , corresponding to option (B). https://grok.com/chat/b10caea9-593f-45c8-a110-704e080ebd22
