how would a rupee dollar swap transaction look like

###### ChatGPT said:

A rupee–dollar swap transaction is essentially an arrangement where two parties agree to exchange a set amount of rupees for dollars (or vice versa) at one date and then reverse the exchange at a later date. This kind of transaction is used to hedge against currency risk or to secure financing in a foreign currency without having to actually borrow in that currency directly.

Let’s break it down step by step:

---

### 1\. Two Legs of the Transaction

- **Near Leg (Initial Exchange):**  
	At the beginning of the transaction (say, today), one party exchanges rupees for dollars at the current (or agreed) spot rate. For example, if an Indian firm needs dollars to pay an overseas supplier, it might enter into a swap where it receives dollars and delivers rupees.
- **Far Leg (Reverse Exchange):**  
	At a pre-agreed future date (say, three months later), the parties reverse the transaction. This time, the exchange is done at a forward rate that is pre-determined at the inception of the swap. The forward rate is set based on the interest rate differential between the two currencies, which means it reflects the cost of borrowing in rupees versus dollars over that period.

---

### 2\. How the Forward Rate is Determined

The forward rate is not chosen arbitrarily—it reflects the interest rate parity between the two currencies. In simple terms, if the domestic (Indian) interest rate is higher than the foreign (U.S.) interest rate, the forward rate for the rupee might be higher (meaning more rupees per dollar) than the current spot rate. A simplified formula to understand this relationship is:

$$
\text{Forward Rate} = \text{Spot Rate} \times \frac{1 + (\text{Domestic Interest Rate} \times \text{Time Period})}{1 + (\text{Foreign Interest Rate} \times \text{Time Period})}
$$

For instance, if the spot rate is 74 rupees per dollar, the Indian interest rate is 6% per annum, and the U.S. interest rate is 2% per annum over a quarter-year period, the forward rate would adjust accordingly. This ensures that neither party gains an unfair advantage due to differing borrowing costs in their respective currencies.

---

### 3\. Example Scenario

Imagine an Indian exporter expecting a payment in dollars but needing rupees for operations:

- **At Initiation (Day 0):**
	- The exporter enters a swap with a bank.
	- The bank gives the exporter dollars, and the exporter gives the bank rupees at the current spot rate.
- **During the Life of the Swap:**
	- The exporter uses the dollars received to settle international obligations, while the bank might use the rupees for its local operations.
- **At Maturity (Day 90):**
	- The swap contract requires the reverse exchange.
	- The exporter now gives back the dollars to the bank, and the bank returns rupees at the predetermined forward rate.

This setup allows the exporter to avoid the uncertainty of fluctuating exchange rates, as the rate at which the funds will be reversed is locked in at the outset.

---

### 4\. Why Use a Swap?

- **Risk Management:**  
	The primary purpose is hedging. If the rupee were to depreciate or appreciate unexpectedly, both parties are protected because the reverse exchange rate is already set.
- **Cost Efficiency:**  
	Instead of engaging in separate borrowing or lending arrangements in two different currencies, a swap provides a single integrated contract that is often more cost-effective and administratively simpler.
- **Flexibility:**  
	Swaps can be tailored to match the specific timing and amount needs of the parties involved, making them versatile instruments for managing currency exposure.

---

### 5\. Visualizing the Transaction

Imagine the timeline below:

```markdown
lessTime 0 (Today)                     Time T (Future Date)
----------------------------------------------------------
Party A (Indian firm):   Gives rupees       Receives rupees
                        Receives dollars       Gives dollars
Party B (Bank/Counterparty): Receives rupees    Gives rupees
                        Gives dollars        Receives dollars
```
- **At Time 0:**  
	The exchange occurs at the **spot rate**.
- **At Time T:**  
	The reverse exchange takes place at the **forward rate**.

---

### 6\. Additional Considerations

- **Credit Risk:**  
	Even though the rate is locked in, both parties need to consider the creditworthiness of their counterparty. Often, collateral or margin requirements are part of the agreement.
- **Accounting Treatment:**  
	For the companies involved, such swaps might be treated as hedging instruments on their balance sheets, which can affect how gains and losses are recognized in financial statements.
- **Market Conditions:**  
	The actual rates (both spot and forward) are influenced by market conditions, such as central bank policies, economic indicators, and market sentiment about the respective economies.

---

In summary, a rupee-dollar swap is a financial instrument that allows parties to exchange currencies now and reverse the transaction later at predetermined rates. It’s a practical tool for managing currency risk and financing needs, with the mechanics rooted in the principles of interest rate parity and forward market expectations.

what happened with Indusind bank in that case

###### ChatGPT said:

IndusInd Bank ran into serious trouble with its foreign exchange derivatives—many of which involved rupee–dollar swap transactions—because its internal processes didn’t properly capture the true cost of hedging. In essence, the bank was using a two-tiered approach:

1. **Internal vs. External Hedging:**  
	The bank’s internal trading desk was set up to hedge currency exposures through swap transactions (like exchanging rupees for dollars and later reversing the swap). However, unlike standard market practices, the bank’s internal desk didn’t adjust the value of these swaps to market prices on a daily basis. Gains were booked immediately, but losses were deferred or under-reported.
2. **The Resulting Discrepancy:**  
	This mismatch in accounting meant that, over several years, the bank’s books understated the true cost of hedging. When new RBI rules forced all derivative transactions to be marked-to-market, the discrepancy came to light—a gap of roughly $175 million (or about 2.35% of the bank's net worth) was identified. The revelation led to a dramatic market reaction: IndusInd Bank’s stock plunged by about 27% in one day, erasing billions in market value.
3. **Management and Regulatory Repercussions:**  
	This accounting lapse raised red flags about the bank's internal controls and governance. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) responded by scrutinizing the bank’s practices and even limited the tenure extension for its CEO, Sumant Kathpalia, to just one year instead of the usual three, signaling regulatory concern over his leadership and the bank’s risk management practices.

In summary, IndusInd Bank’s troubles stemmed from using an internal swap mechanism that didn’t correctly account for market fluctuations—leading to a significant underestimation of losses. This mismanagement not only damaged investor confidence (as reflected in the stock plunge) but also attracted increased regulatory attention, potentially affecting the entire sector’s credibility in handling complex derivatives.

##### You said:

Can you explain the transaction or the scenario how it must have happened

###### ChatGPT said:

Let's imagine a scenario step by step that shows how the rupee–dollar swap transaction might have unfolded—and where the missteps occurred.

---

### 1\. The Need to Hedge Currency Exposure

Suppose IndusInd Bank has significant foreign currency liabilities or deposits (for example, USD borrowings or deposits from corporate clients). To protect itself from fluctuations in the exchange rate between the US dollar and the Indian rupee, the bank wants to lock in an exchange rate for a future date.

---

### 2\. Entering into a Swap Transaction

**a. The Initial (Near) Leg:**  
At time T₀, the bank’s Asset and Liability Management (ALM) desk enters into an agreement with its internal trading desk. In this internal swap, the bank exchanges rupees for dollars at a spot rate. For instance, it might convert ₹740 million to $10 million at the prevailing rate.

**b. The External Hedge:**  
Soon after, the bank’s trading desk goes to the external market and enters into a corresponding swap (or forward contract) with an external counterparty. This external deal is fully marked-to-market on a daily basis, meaning its value is revalued as market conditions change.

*Example:*

- **Internal Trade:** ALM desk and trading desk agree on a fixed rate, say 1 USD = 74 INR.
- **External Trade:** The trading desk enters into a forward swap with another bank to hedge the same $10 million at a rate that fluctuates with market conditions.

---

### 3\. Accounting for Gains and Losses

**a. Internal vs. External Treatment:**

- **Internal Swap:** The bank’s internal swap might have been booked at a fixed, predetermined rate. Profits arising when market conditions are favorable (for example, if the rupee weakens) are recorded immediately.
- **External Swap:** The external swap is marked-to-market daily, meaning that if market rates move against the bank, losses are recognized right away.

**b. The Mismatch:**  
The problem arose because the internal swap’s losses weren’t recognized as promptly as those on the external swap. For years, while gains were booked on the internal trades, any adverse movements (losses) were either deferred or understated.

*Imagine this simplified scenario:*

- **At Initiation:** Both swaps are aligned; the bank hedges $10 million at 74 INR per USD.
- **Market Moves:** Later, the external swap shows a loss because the market rate moves to, say, 75 INR per USD—meaning it would cost more rupees to buy back the dollars. The trading desk records a loss of, say, ₹10 million.
- **Internal Swap Accounting:** However, the internal swap remains booked at the fixed rate of 74 INR per USD, and its losses are not adjusted in real time. Over time, these deferred losses accumulate.

---

### 4\. The Regulatory Trigger

In April 2024, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) issued new guidelines mandating that all derivative transactions—including internal hedges—be marked to market on a regular (typically daily) basis. This change meant that any mismatches in the valuation between internal and external trades could no longer be hidden.

**When the bank revalued its internal swaps:**

- The previously unrecorded or under-recorded losses were suddenly recognized.
- The cumulative impact turned out to be significant—about $175 million or 2.35% of the bank’s net worth.

---

### 5\. The Aftermath

- **Market Reaction:**  
	Investors, alarmed by this sizeable write-down, reacted swiftly, causing the bank’s stock price to drop by roughly 27% in one day.
- **Governance and Oversight Issues:**  
	The discrepancy raised serious concerns about the bank’s internal controls and risk management practices. In response, regulators scrutinized the bank’s operations, and the RBI even limited the CEO’s extension to just one year—a signal of regulatory caution.

---

### Putting It All Together

1. **Initial Setup:**
	- ALM desk enters an internal swap (rupees for dollars) at a fixed rate.
	- The trading desk hedges externally with a daily marked-to-market swap.
2. **Mismatch in Accounting:**
	- Internal trades book gains immediately but defer losses.
	- External trades accurately reflect daily losses due to market movements.
3. **Regulatory Change:**
	- RBI’s new rules force the bank to revalue all swaps.
	- Deferred losses from internal swaps are recognized, revealing a large gap.
4. **Market Impact and Governance Repercussions:**
	- The bank’s net worth is hit by a one-time adjustment.
	- Investor trust falters, leading to a steep stock price decline.
	- Regulators question the bank’s oversight, impacting leadership tenure.

---

This step-by-step example illustrates how a seemingly routine rupee–dollar swap transaction could evolve into a significant accounting and risk management issue when different parts of the bank treat similar transactions inconsistently. The result is a delayed but sharp realization of losses that can dramatically affect both the bank’s financial statements and market confidence.

##### You said:

can you explain the transaction a bit more clearly

###### ChatGPT said:

Let's break it down using a simple, step-by-step example:

---

### Imagine a Timeline of the Swap Transaction

1. **The Problem to Solve: Hedging Currency Risk**
	- **Scenario:**  
		IndusInd Bank has large amounts of dollars coming in and going out (for example, through foreign deposits or loans).
	- **Risk:**  
		Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the Indian rupee and the US dollar can hurt the bank’s profits or increase its costs.
	- **Solution:**  
		To protect itself, the bank wants to lock in an exchange rate for a future date by entering into a swap.
2. **Step 1: Initiating the Swap (Near Leg)**
	- **Internal Transaction:**  
		The bank’s ALM (Asset & Liability Management) desk makes an internal deal with its trading desk.
		- **Example:**  
			Suppose the bank converts ₹740 million into $10 million at a spot rate of 1 USD = 74 INR.
		- **Purpose:**  
			This gives the bank the dollars it needs while fixing the exchange rate at the time of the transaction.
3. **Step 2: Hedging with the External Market (Far Leg)**
	- **External Transaction:**  
		Almost immediately, the bank’s trading desk goes to the external market (dealing with another bank or financial institution) to set up a corresponding forward contract.
		- **Forward Contract:**  
			This agreement locks in a rate for converting the dollars back into rupees on a future date.
		- **Daily Revaluation:**  
			In the external market, the value of this forward contract is revalued (or "marked-to-market") every day. That means any gains or losses due to changes in the exchange rate are recognized right away.
4. **Step 3: The Mismatch in Accounting**
	- **Internal vs. External Treatment:**
		- **External Contract:**  
			Because it is marked-to-market daily, if the market rate changes (say the rupee weakens to 75 INR per USD), the loss (or gain) is immediately recorded.
		- **Internal Contract:**  
			The internal swap was booked at the fixed rate (74 INR per USD) and did not adjust daily.
	- **What Happens Over Time:**  
		If the market moves against the bank (e.g., the rupee weakens), the external hedge shows a loss. But since the internal transaction wasn’t updated daily, those losses are not recorded in the same way.
		- **Result:**  
			This creates a hidden or “deferred” loss that accumulates over time.
5. **Step 4: Regulatory Intervention and the Big Realization**
	- **RBI Rule Change:**  
		The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) later required that all such derivative transactions (even internal ones) be marked-to-market regularly.
	- **Effect:**  
		When IndusInd Bank was forced to revalue its internal swaps, it discovered that a significant loss (around $175 million or 2.35% of its net worth) had built up over the years because those losses weren’t recorded on time.
6. **Step 5: Consequences of the Mismatch**
	- **Immediate Impact:**  
		The sudden recognition of these losses led to a sharp drop in the bank’s stock price (about 27% in a day).
	- **Long-Term Concerns:**  
		Investors and regulators became worried about the bank’s internal controls and overall risk management practices.

### A Simplified Visual Representation

```markdown
sqlTime 0 (Initiation)
-------------------------------
Internal Swap:
   ALM Desk  <--> Trading Desk
   Exchange rupees for dollars at fixed rate (e.g., 74 INR/USD)

External Hedge:
   Trading Desk  <--> External Counterparty
   Enters a forward contract (marked-to-market daily)

Time T (Future Date)
-------------------------------
Reverse the transactions:
   - Internal swap was supposed to reverse at 74 INR/USD
   - External forward contract now has a market-adjusted rate (say, 75 INR/USD)
   -> The mismatch between the fixed internal rate and the fluctuating external rate creates a loss.
```

---

### In Short

- **What the Bank Tried to Do:**  
	Use an internal swap to manage currency risk by locking in an exchange rate, while hedging in the external market.
- **Where Things Went Wrong:**  
	The bank treated the internal swap differently—recording gains immediately but deferring or understating losses—while the external hedge was updated daily. When regulations forced the internal swap to be revalued, the accumulated hidden losses became clear, leading to a significant write-down and a loss of investor confidence.

This clear step-by-step process shows how a routine hedging transaction can spiral into a major issue if the internal controls and accounting practices don’t match up with market standards.

##### You said:

why the rupee going to 75 will show a loss\\

###### ChatGPT said:

Let's break it down with a simple numerical example:

1. **Initial Transaction:**  
	Imagine the bank enters into a swap at a fixed rate of 74 INR per USD. In this swap, the bank converts rupees to dollars. For example, it exchanges ₹740 million to receive $10 million.
2. **What Happens When the Rupee Depreciates:**  
	Now suppose that over time, the market conditions change and the rupee weakens such that the current market rate is 75 INR per USD. This means if you were to exchange dollars for rupees now, you’d get 75 rupees for every dollar, not 74.
3. **Impact on the Swap:**
	- **Internal Swap (Fixed at 74):**  
		The bank’s internal books still reflect the exchange rate of 74 INR per USD because they did not adjust (or “mark-to-market”) the value of this internal swap on a daily basis.
	- **Market Reality (75 INR per USD):**  
		If the bank were to reverse the transaction in today’s market, it would now receive 75 rupees for every dollar.
4. **The Loss Explained:**  
	Because the bank is locked into the rate of 74 INR per USD in its internal swap, when it finally reconciles or reverses the transaction, it faces a discrepancy:
	- **Expected Value at Market Rate:**  
		$10 million × 75 INR/USD = ₹750 million.
	- **Book Value from Internal Swap:**  
		$10 million × 74 INR/USD = ₹740 million.
	The bank would have received ₹750 million if it had been using the current market rate. Instead, it only records ₹740 million. That 1 rupee difference per dollar results in an effective loss of:
	$$
	1 \text{ INR/USD} \times 10 \text{ million USD} = 10 \text{ million INR}
	$$
	Multiply this loss across all such transactions over time, and the cumulative effect can be very significant.
5. **Why This Mismatch is a Problem:**  
	The internal swap’s fixed rate (74 INR/USD) doesn’t reflect the current market reality (75 INR/USD). Because the losses due to the rupee depreciation weren’t recognized immediately (i.e., not marked-to-market), they accumulate. When regulators require the bank to mark its internal swaps to market, all these deferred losses become apparent—contributing to a write-down on the bank's net worth.

In summary, when the rupee depreciates from 74 to 75 INR per USD, the bank loses the opportunity to benefit from the higher exchange rate. Instead, it’s stuck with a rate that underestimates the true cost of reversing the swap, thereby showing a loss when the internal swap is eventually revalued.

##### You said:

but then how is it a loss for the bank in what way

###### ChatGPT said:

Think of it this way: the bank entered into a swap that locked in an exchange rate of 74 INR per USD. When the market moves and the current rate becomes 75 INR per USD, the bank is now "stuck" with the lower rate. Here's how that creates a loss:

1. **Opportunity Cost on Conversion:**  
	If the bank had the flexibility to convert dollars at the current market rate, it would get more rupees. For example, with $10 million:
	- At 75 INR/USD: The bank would receive ₹750 million.
	- But at 74 INR/USD (the locked rate): The bank only gets ₹740 million.  
		The difference of ₹10 million is effectively lost money compared to what could be earned at the market rate.
2. **Accounting Impact:**  
	This difference isn't just a hypothetical gap—it gets recorded in the bank’s financial statements when the swap is marked-to-market (i.e., revalued to reflect current market conditions).
	- The bank’s assets (or liabilities) are adjusted to reflect the market rate, so the 1 INR difference per dollar becomes a recognized loss.
	- Over many such transactions and over time, these individual differences add up, reducing the bank’s reported net worth.
3. **Risk Management and Balance Sheet Effects:**
	- **Deferred Losses:** If losses on the internal swap are not recorded immediately (as was the case here), they accumulate. When regulatory changes force the bank to recognize these losses, the cumulative effect can be significant.
	- **Eroded Capital:** A reduction in net worth means the bank’s capital base is lower, which can have further implications for its lending capacity, investor confidence, and regulatory compliance.

So, the loss for the bank isn’t just an abstract number—it represents a real discrepancy between what the bank would ideally have received (if it could use the current market rate) versus what it is obligated to receive because of the locked-in swap rate. This shortfall, when finally recognized, directly reduces the bank’s financial metrics and can trigger a cascade of negative reactions from investors and regulators.
