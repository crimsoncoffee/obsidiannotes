Let’s solve this economics problem step-by-step to determine the cost-minimizing combination of labor $L^*$  and capital $K^*$  given the production function $Y(L, K) = \min\{2L, K\}$  , the cost function $C(L, K) = wL + rK$  (where $w > 0$  and $r > 0$  ), and the constraint $Y(L, K) \geq \tilde{Y}$  , where $\tilde{Y}$  is a specified output level. Our goal is to find $L^*$  and $K^*$  in terms of $\tilde{Y}$  and select the correct multiple-choice option.

---

### Step 1: Understand the Production Function

The production function $Y(L, K) = \min\{2L, K\}$  is a Leontief (fixed-proportions) type, meaning output $Y$  is determined by the smaller of $2L$  (twice the labor input) or $K$  (the capital input). To produce an output $Y$  , we need:

- $2L \geq Y$  , so $L \geq Y / 2$  ,
- $K \geq Y$  .

The constraint requires $Y(L, K) \geq \tilde{Y}$  , so:

- $\min\{2L, K\} \geq \tilde{Y}$  .

This implies both conditions must hold:

- $2L \geq \tilde{Y}$  , i.e., $L \geq \tilde{Y} / 2$  ,
- $K \geq \tilde{Y}$  .

If either $2L < \tilde{Y}$  or $K < \tilde{Y}$  , then $Y = \min\{2L, K\} < \tilde{Y}$  , violating the constraint. Thus, the feasible set of $(L, K)$  is all pairs where $L \geq \tilde{Y} / 2$  and $K \geq \tilde{Y}$  .

---

### Step 2: Formulate the Cost Minimization Problem

We need to minimize the cost: $C(L, K) = wL + rK,$  subject to: $Y(L, K) = \min\{2L, K\} \geq \tilde{Y},$  with $w > 0$  , $r > 0$  , and $L, K \geq 0$  (non-negativity is typical in such problems, though not explicitly stated).

Since $w$  and $r$  are positive, the cost function increases as $L$  or $K$  increases. To minimize cost while satisfying $\min\{2L, K\} \geq \tilde{Y}$  , we should use the smallest possible values of $L$  and $K$  that meet the constraint.

---

### Step 3: Identify the Efficient Input Combination

In a Leontief production function like $Y = \min\{2L, K\}$  , producing output efficiently (without wasting inputs) occurs when the arguments of the min function are equal. Suppose we produce exactly $Y = \tilde{Y}$  :

- $Y = \min\{2L, K\} = \tilde{Y}$  .

For $Y = 2L$  if $2L \leq K$  , or $Y = K$  if $K \leq 2L$  , the minimum must be $\tilde{Y}$  . The cost-minimizing approach avoids excess inputs:

- If $2L > K$  , then $Y = K$  , and extra labor beyond $2L = K$  is wasted.
- If $K > 2L$  , then $Y = 2L$  , and extra capital beyond $K = 2L$  is wasted.

Setting $2L = K$  :

- $Y = \min\{2L, K\} = 2L = K$  .

If $Y = \tilde{Y}$  :

- $2L = K = \tilde{Y}$  ,
- $L = \tilde{Y} / 2$  ,
- $K = \tilde{Y}$  .

Check:

- $Y = \min\{2 \cdot (\tilde{Y} / 2), \tilde{Y}\} = \min\{\tilde{Y}, \tilde{Y}\} = \tilde{Y}$  ,
- $Y \geq \tilde{Y}$  is satisfied.

---

### Step 4: Verify Cost Minimization

The cost at $L = \tilde{Y} / 2$  , $K = \tilde{Y}$  is: $C = w \cdot (\tilde{Y} / 2) + r \cdot \tilde{Y} = (w / 2) \tilde{Y} + r \tilde{Y} = \left( \frac{w}{2} + r \right) \tilde{Y}.$

- **Can $L < \tilde{Y} / 2$  ?** If $L < \tilde{Y} / 2$  , then $2L < \tilde{Y}$  , so $Y = \min\{2L, K\} = 2L < \tilde{Y}$  , violating the constraint. Thus, $L \geq \tilde{Y} / 2$  .
- **Can $K < \tilde{Y}$  ?** If $K < \tilde{Y}$  , then $Y = \min\{2L, K\} = K < \tilde{Y}$  , again violating the constraint. Thus, $K \geq \tilde{Y}$  .

Now, consider alternatives:

- If $L > \tilde{Y} / 2$  , $K = \tilde{Y}$  , then $Y = \min\{2L, \tilde{Y}\} = \tilde{Y}$  (since $2L > \tilde{Y}$  ), but cost $wL + r \tilde{Y} > w (\tilde{Y} / 2) + r \tilde{Y}$  because $w (L - \tilde{Y} / 2) > 0$  .
- If $K > \tilde{Y}$  , $L = \tilde{Y} / 2$  , then $Y = \min\{\tilde{Y}, K\} = \tilde{Y}$  (since $K > \tilde{Y}$  ), but cost $w (\tilde{Y} / 2) + r K > w (\tilde{Y} / 2) + r \tilde{Y}$  because $r (K - \tilde{Y}) > 0$  .

Producing $Y > \tilde{Y}$  (e.g., $2L = K > \tilde{Y}$  ) increases both $L$  and $K$  , raising cost unnecessarily. Since the constraint is $Y \geq \tilde{Y}$  and cost is increasing, the minimum cost occurs at $Y = \tilde{Y}$  , achieved efficiently at $2L = K = \tilde{Y}$  .

---

### Step 5: Evaluate the Options

- **(A) $L^* = \tilde{Y}$  , $K^* = \tilde{Y} / 2$  :**
	- $Y = \min\{2 \cdot \tilde{Y}, \tilde{Y} / 2\} = \tilde{Y} / 2$  .
	- If $\tilde{Y} > 0$  , $\tilde{Y} / 2 < \tilde{Y}$  , so the constraint fails.
	- Invalid.
- **(B) $L^* = \tilde{Y}$  , $K^* = \tilde{Y}$  :**
	- $Y = \min\{2 \cdot \tilde{Y}, \tilde{Y}\} = \tilde{Y}$  , satisfies the constraint.
	- Cost = $w \tilde{Y} + r \tilde{Y} = (w + r) \tilde{Y}$  .
	- Compare to $L = \tilde{Y} / 2$  , $K = \tilde{Y}$  : $(w / 2 + r) \tilde{Y} < (w + r) \tilde{Y}$  since $w / 2 > 0$  .
	- Higher cost, not optimal.
- **(C) $L^* = \tilde{Y} / 2$  , $K^* = \tilde{Y}$  :**
	- $Y = \min\{\tilde{Y}, \tilde{Y}\} = \tilde{Y}$  , satisfies the constraint.
	- Cost = $(w / 2) \tilde{Y} + r \tilde{Y}$  .
	- Matches our solution.
- **(D) None of the other options is correct:**
	- Only if (C) is incorrect, which we’ll confirm.

Since $L^* = \tilde{Y} / 2$  , $K^* = \tilde{Y}$  minimizes cost by setting $2L = K = \tilde{Y}$  , and no lower values satisfy the constraint, (C) is correct.

---

### Final Answer

The cost-minimizing combination is:

- $L^* = \tilde{Y} / 2$  ,
- $K^* = \tilde{Y}$  .

Correct option: **(C)**.

you sure?

Yes, I’m confident in the answer. Let me walk you through the reasoning to confirm the cost-minimizing combination for the production function $Y(L, K) = \min\{2L, K\}$  , with the cost function $C(L, K) = wL + rK$  , and the constraint $Y(L, K) \geq \tilde{Y}$  .

---

### Understanding the Production Function

The production function $Y(L, K) = \min\{2L, K\}$  is a Leontief (fixed-proportions) type, meaning output $Y$  is limited by the smaller of $2L$  or $K$  . To meet the constraint $Y \geq \tilde{Y}$  , we need:

- $2L \geq \tilde{Y}$  , so $L \geq \tilde{Y} / 2$  ,
- $K \geq \tilde{Y}$  .

If either $2L < \tilde{Y}$  or $K < \tilde{Y}$  , then $Y = \min\{2L, K\} < \tilde{Y}$  , which fails the constraint. So, these inequalities set the minimum feasible inputs.

---

### Finding the Efficient Combination

For a Leontief production function, the cost is minimized when inputs are used efficiently, with no waste. Waste occurs if:

- $2L > K$  , where $Y = K$  , and extra labor is unused,
- $K > 2L$  , where $Y = 2L$  , and extra capital is unused.

Efficiency happens when $2L = K$  . To produce exactly $Y = \tilde{Y}$  (which is sufficient since the constraint is $Y \geq \tilde{Y}$  ):

- Set $2L = K = \tilde{Y}$  ,
- Solve: $L = \tilde{Y} / 2$  , $K = \tilde{Y}$  .

Check: $Y = \min\{2L, K\} = \min\{2 \cdot \tilde{Y} / 2, \tilde{Y}\} = \min\{\tilde{Y}, \tilde{Y}\} = \tilde{Y}$  . This satisfies the constraint with equality.

---

### Calculating the Cost

The cost at $L = \tilde{Y} / 2$  , $K = \tilde{Y}$  is: $C = w \cdot \frac{\tilde{Y}}{2} + r \cdot \tilde{Y} = \left( \frac{w}{2} + r \right) \tilde{Y}.$  We need to verify if this is the minimum possible cost.

---

### Testing Alternatives

1. **Increase $L$  , keep $K = \tilde{Y}$  :**
	- Let $L > \tilde{Y} / 2$  , $K = \tilde{Y}$  ,
	- $Y = \min\{2L, \tilde{Y}\} = \tilde{Y}$  (since $2L > \tilde{Y}$  ),
	- Cost: $C = wL + r \tilde{Y} > w \cdot \frac{\tilde{Y}}{2} + r \tilde{Y}$  , because $w (L - \tilde{Y}/2) > 0$  .
	- Higher cost, same output.
2. **Increase $K$  , keep $L = \tilde{Y} / 2$  :**
	- Let $L = \tilde{Y} / 2$  , $K > \tilde{Y}$  ,
	- $Y = \min\{\tilde{Y}, K\} = \tilde{Y}$  (since $K > \tilde{Y}$  ),
	- Cost: $C = w \cdot \frac{\tilde{Y}}{2} + r K > w \cdot \frac{\tilde{Y}}{2} + r \tilde{Y}$  , because $r (K - \tilde{Y}) > 0$  .
	- Higher cost, same output.
3. **Decrease inputs:**
	- If $L < \tilde{Y} / 2$  , then $2L < \tilde{Y}$  , so $Y = 2L < \tilde{Y}$  , violating the constraint.
	- If $K < \tilde{Y}$  , then $Y = K < \tilde{Y}$  , violating the constraint.
	- No feasible solution here.
4. **Produce more than $\tilde{Y}$  :**
	- Let $2L = K > \tilde{Y}$  , e.g., $L = K / 2$  , $K > \tilde{Y}$  ,
	- $Y = \min\{2L, K\} = K > \tilde{Y}$  , which is fine,
	- Cost: $C = w \cdot \frac{K}{2} + r K = \left( \frac{w}{2} + r \right) K > \left( \frac{w}{2} + r \right) \tilde{Y}$  ,
	- Higher cost for unnecessary output.

Any deviation from $L = \tilde{Y} / 2$  , $K = \tilde{Y}$  either violates the constraint or increases the cost.

---

### Conclusion

The cost-minimizing combination is $L^* = \tilde{Y} / 2$  , $K^* = \tilde{Y}$  , where $2L = K = \tilde{Y}$  , producing $Y = \tilde{Y}$  at the lowest cost $C = \left( \frac{w}{2} + r \right) \tilde{Y}$  . This is optimal because it uses inputs efficiently and meets the constraint without excess expenditure. So, yes, I’m sure this is correct!

So you know which exam I am prepping for right?

I don’t know which specific exam you’re prepping for unless you’ve shared that information with me. However, I’m here to help with any questions or topics you’re studying. If you’d like, you can tell me more about the exam, and I can tailor my assistance to your needs!

I am preparing for ISI MSQE

I understand you're preparing for the ISI MSQE (Indian Statistical Institute Master of Science in Quantitative Economics) exam—great choice! This is a rigorous program that tests your understanding of microeconomics, macroeconomics, and quantitative methods. Since you’ve reached out, I’ll assume you’re looking for help with a specific problem, likely related to cost minimization, which is a key topic in microeconomics. Let’s dive into a typical problem you might encounter, involving a Leontief production function, and solve it step-by-step to aid your preparation.

---

### Problem Setup

Suppose you’re given:

- A production function: $Y(L, K) = \min\{2L, K\}$
- A cost function: $C(L, K) = wL + rK$  (where $w > 0$  is the wage rate and $r > 0$  is the rental rate of capital)
- A constraint: $Y(L, K) \geq \tilde{Y}$  (where $\tilde{Y}$  is the target output)

Your task is to find the cost-minimizing combination of labor $L^*$  and capital $K^*$  in terms of $\tilde{Y}$  .

---

### Step-by-Step Solution

#### Step 1: Understand the Production Function

The production function $Y(L, K) = \min\{2L, K\}$  is a **Leontief (fixed-proportions)** type. This means:

- Output $Y$  is limited by the smaller of $2L$  or $K$  .
- To produce $Y$  units of output efficiently, labor $L$  and capital $K$  must be used in a fixed ratio: $2L = K$  .
- If $2L > K$  , extra labor is wasted because output is capped by $K$  . If $K > 2L$  , extra capital is wasted because output is capped by $2L$  .

For example, to produce $Y = 10$  :

- $2L \geq 10$  , so $L \geq 5$
- $K \geq 10$
- The efficient point is $2L = K = 10$  , or $L = 5$  , $K = 10$  .

---

#### Step 2: Define the Cost Minimization Problem

We need to:

- Minimize: $C(L, K) = wL + rK$
- Subject to: $\min\{2L, K\} \geq \tilde{Y}$
- With: $L \geq 0$  , $K \geq 0$

Since $w$  and $r$  are positive, increasing $L$  or $K$  raises costs. Thus, we want the smallest $L$  and $K$  that satisfy the output constraint.

---

#### Step 3: Find the Efficient Input Combination

For a Leontief production function, cost minimization occurs where inputs are used in the exact proportion $2L = K$  . Why? Any deviation wastes resources:

- If $2L < K$  , you’re using excess capital.
- If $2L > K$  , you’re using excess labor.

Given the constraint $\min\{2L, K\} \geq \tilde{Y}$  , the minimum output we need is $Y = \tilde{Y}$  (producing more increases costs unnecessarily). At this point: $2L = K = \tilde{Y}$

Solve for $L$  and $K$  :

- $L^* = \frac{\tilde{Y}}{2}$
- $K^* = \tilde{Y}$

---

#### Step 4: Verify the Solution

- **Constraint check:** $Y(L^*, K^*) = \min\left\{2 \cdot \frac{\tilde{Y}}{2}, \tilde{Y}\right\} = \min\{\tilde{Y}, \tilde{Y}\} = \tilde{Y}$  Since $\tilde{Y} \geq \tilde{Y}$  , the constraint holds.
- **Cost minimization check:**
	- **Less labor?** If $L < \frac{\tilde{Y}}{2}$  , then $2L < \tilde{Y}$  , so $Y = 2L < \tilde{Y}$  , violating the constraint.
	- **Less capital?** If $K < \tilde{Y}$  , then $Y = K < \tilde{Y}$  (assuming $2L \geq K$  ), again violating the constraint.
	- **More inputs?** If $L = \frac{\tilde{Y}}{2} + \epsilon$  and $K = \tilde{Y}$  , then $Y = \tilde{Y}$  , but cost increases to $w(\frac{\tilde{Y}}{2} + \epsilon) + r\tilde{Y} > w\frac{\tilde{Y}}{2} + r\tilde{Y}$  . Similarly, increasing $K$  beyond $\tilde{Y}$  raises costs without increasing output.

Thus, $L^* = \frac{\tilde{Y}}{2}$  , $K^* = \tilde{Y}$  is optimal.

---

#### Step 5: Compute the Minimum Cost

The minimum cost is: $C^* = w L^* + r K^* = w \cdot \frac{\tilde{Y}}{2} + r \cdot \tilde{Y} = \left( \frac{w}{2} + r \right) \tilde{Y}$

---

### Final Answer

The cost-minimizing combination is:

- $L^* = \frac{\tilde{Y}}{2}$
- $K^* = \tilde{Y}$

---

### Exam Tips for ISI MSQE

- **Leontief Functions**: The optimal ratio (here, $2L = K$  ) comes directly from the production function coefficients. Practice identifying this quickly.
- **Constraint Handling**: When costs are positive, meet the constraint with equality unless specified otherwise.
- **Clarity**: In the exam, write each step logically—define the problem, state the key insight (fixed proportions), solve, and verify.

If this matches your query, great! If you have a specific problem in mind, let me know, and I’ll tailor the solution further. Good luck with your preparation!

any other variations of these type of questions that I should be prepared for

Based on your preparation for the ISI MSQE exam, particularly in the context of cost minimization with Leontief production functions, you’ve already covered several key variations (e.g., different coefficients, multiple inputs, input constraints, technology choices, and cost function properties). However, there are additional variations of these types of questions that could appear on the exam. Below, I’ll outline some other possibilities you should be prepared for, ensuring you have a comprehensive grasp of the topic.

---

### 1\. Piecewise Leontief Production Functions

- **Description**: The production function might change its form depending on the output level. For example:
	$$
	Y = 
	\begin{cases} 
	\min\{a_1 L, b_1 K\} & \text{if } Y \leq Y_0 \\
	\min\{a_2 L, b_2 K\} & \text{if } Y > Y_0 
	\end{cases}
	$$
	 where $a_1, b_1$  and $a_2, b_2$  are different coefficients, and $Y_0$  is a threshold output.
- **What to Expect**: You’ll need to determine the cost-minimizing inputs and cost function for a given target output $\tilde{Y}$  , depending on whether $\tilde{Y} \leq Y_0$  or $\tilde{Y} > Y_0$  .
- **Solution Approach**:
	- If $\tilde{Y} \leq Y_0$  , use $Y = \min\{a_1 L, b_1 K\}$  , so $L^* = \frac{\tilde{Y}}{a_1}$  , $K^* = \frac{\tilde{Y}}{b_1}$  , and $C(\tilde{Y}) = w \cdot \frac{\tilde{Y}}{a_1} + r \cdot \frac{\tilde{Y}}{b_1}$  .
	- If $\tilde{Y} > Y_0$  , use $Y = \min\{a_2 L, b_2 K\}$  , so $L^* = \frac{\tilde{Y}}{a_2}$  , $K^* = \frac{\tilde{Y}}{b_2}$  , and $C(\tilde{Y}) = w \cdot \frac{\tilde{Y}}{a_2} + r \cdot \frac{\tilde{Y}}{b_2}$  .
- **Example**: If $Y = \min\{2L, K\}$  for $Y \leq 10$  and $Y = \min\{L, 2K\}$  for $Y > 10$  , find the cost for $\tilde{Y} = 8$  and $\tilde{Y} = 12$  .

---

### 2\. Leontief with Minimum Input Thresholds

- **Description**: The production function might require a minimum amount of inputs before any output is produced, e.g., $Y = \min\{a(L - L_0), b(K - K_0)\}$  , where $L_0$  and $K_0$  are fixed input requirements.
- **What to Expect**: You need to account for these thresholds when calculating the optimal inputs and cost.
- **Solution Approach**:
	- Set $a(L - L_0) = b(K - K_0) = \tilde{Y}$  .
	- Solve: $L - L_0 = \frac{\tilde{Y}}{a}$  , so $L^* = L_0 + \frac{\tilde{Y}}{a}$  ; $K - K_0 = \frac{\tilde{Y}}{b}$  , so $K^* = K_0 + \frac{\tilde{Y}}{b}$  .
	- Cost: $C(\tilde{Y}) = w (L_0 + \frac{\tilde{Y}}{a}) + r (K_0 + \frac{\tilde{Y}}{b})$  .
- **Example**: For $Y = \min\{2(L - 1), K - 2\}$  , if $\tilde{Y} = 4$  , then $L^* = 1 + \frac{4}{2} = 3$  , $K^* = 2 + \frac{4}{1} = 6$  .

---

### 3\. Fixed Costs Combined with Leontief Production

- **Description**: The cost minimization problem might include fixed costs in addition to variable costs, e.g., total cost = $F + wL + rK$  , where $F$  is a fixed cost.
- **What to Expect**: While fixed costs don’t affect the optimal input combination, they alter the total cost function, and you might be asked to derive or interpret it.
- **Solution Approach**:
	- Optimal inputs remain $L^* = \frac{\tilde{Y}}{a}$  , $K^* = \frac{\tilde{Y}}{b}$  for $Y = \min\{aL, bK\}$  .
	- Total cost: $C(\tilde{Y}) = F + w \cdot \frac{\tilde{Y}}{a} + r \cdot \frac{\tilde{Y}}{b}$  .
- **Example**: If $F = 10$  , $Y = \min\{2L, K\}$  , then $C(\tilde{Y}) = 10 + w \cdot \frac{\tilde{Y}}{2} + r \cdot \tilde{Y}$  .

---

### 4\. Profit Maximization with a Leontief Function

- **Description**: Instead of just cost minimization, you might be asked to maximize profit for a firm that’s a price taker in the output market with price $p$  , using a Leontief production function.
- **What to Expect**: Profit is $\pi = pY - (wL + rK)$  , and you need to find the optimal output and inputs.
- **Solution Approach**:
	- Cost function: $C(Y) = \left( \frac{w}{a} + \frac{r}{b} \right) Y$  , so marginal cost $MC = \frac{w}{a} + \frac{r}{b}$  .
	- Since $MC$  is constant and there are constant returns to scale, set $p = MC$  for profit maximization. If $p > MC$  , produce infinitely; if $p < MC$  , produce zero; if $p = MC$  , output is indeterminate without additional constraints.
- **Example**: For $Y = \min\{2L, K\}$  , if $p = 5$  , $w = 2$  , $r = 1$  , then $MC = \frac{2}{2} + \frac{1}{1} = 2$  . Since $p > MC$  , output could be any level, but additional constraints (e.g., input limits) might be provided.

---

### 5\. Non-Standard Input Combinations

- **Description**: The exam might ask what happens if the firm deviates from the efficient input ratio, e.g., using $aL > bK$  or $aL < bK$  .
- **What to Expect**: You’ll need to show that any deviation increases costs unnecessarily due to the fixed-proportions nature of Leontief functions.
- **Solution Approach**:
	- For $Y = \min\{aL, bK\} = \tilde{Y}$  , the minimum output is determined by the smaller of $aL$  or $bK$  .
	- If $aL > bK$  , then $Y = bK < aL$  , and excess labor is wasted. Cost is higher than necessary: $C = wL + rK > w \cdot \frac{\tilde{Y}}{a} + r \cdot \frac{\tilde{Y}}{b}$  .
- **Example**: For $Y = \min\{2L, K\} = 10$  , efficient point is $L = 5$  , $K = 10$  . If $L = 6$  , $K = 10$  , then $Y = \min\{12, 10\} = 10$  , but cost increases by $w \cdot 1$  .

---

### 6\. Graphical Representation

- **Description**: You might be asked to draw the isoquant and cost line for a Leontief function and identify the cost-minimizing point graphically.
- **What to Expect**: The isoquant is L-shaped, and the cost line’s intersection with the vertex gives the solution.
- **Solution Approach**:
	- Isoquant for $Y = \min\{aL, bK\} = \tilde{Y}$  is where $aL = \tilde{Y}$  (vertical segment) and $bK = \tilde{Y}$  (horizontal segment), meeting at $L = \frac{\tilde{Y}}{a}$  , $K = \frac{\tilde{Y}}{b}$  .
	- Cost line: $wL + rK = C$  . The minimum cost occurs at the vertex.
- **Example**: For $Y = \min\{2L, K\} = 10$  , vertex is $L = 5$  , $K = 10$  .

---

### Preparation Tips
