The confusion reflects intellectual disagreement. Some pundits reckon that the recent rise in inflation is a mirage. Statisticians adjust data to reflect events that happen at a particular time of the year (such as the price rises that many shops impose in January). The covid-19 pandemic, which created huge volatility, has messed up these seasonal adjustments, which could make month-on-month inflation readings in January and February higher than the “true” rate of inflation. Others point out that headline inflation always jumps about, owing to volatile commodity prices. Economists at Morgan Stanley, a bank, reckon that the recent wildfires in California may have temporarily pushed up goods prices in America. In January a number of countries, including Belgium and Norway, saw large increases in the price of food, perhaps linked to worries over a trade war. Central bankers typically ignore these blips when setting monetary policy.

Compared with before the pandemic, companies and workers may react more strongly to these pro-inflation forces. In 2023 a paper published by the Bank for International Settlements, a club of central banks, discussed what happens in “a transition to \[a\] high-inflation regime”, in which rising prices become “a more focal point for workers and firms”. Once people have experienced rapidly rising prices, they worry about it happening again. If workers perceive that inflation is on the march, they may be particularly quick to ask for a pay rise.

There is a similar “inflation perception gap” in America. Canada’s inflation rate has been at or below 2% since August. And yet Canadians still expect inflation of 3% over the next year, compared with 2.4% before the pandemic.
