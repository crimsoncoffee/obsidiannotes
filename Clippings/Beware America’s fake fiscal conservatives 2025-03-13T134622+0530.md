which raised deficits by $1.7tn, are set to expire at the end of 2025

The expiry was also necessary to clear the procedural hurdle for “reconciliation”, which allows new budget-related laws to avoid a filibuster in the Senate only if they would do nothing to increase deficits after the first 10 year

Swallowing $1.7tn in new deficits was hard enough [in 2017](https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/recurringdata/51118-2017-06-budgetprojections.xlsx), when the annual budget deficit was $693bn and the federal government spent $269bn to service $15tn of public debt. Increasing them further [in 2025](https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2025-01/51118-2025-01-Budget-Projections.xlsx), when the annual budget deficit stands at $1.9tn and the federal government is spending $952bn to service more than $30tn of public debt, is insane. Even with the expiry of the TCJA, the Congressional Budget Office expects the deficit to reach $2.1tn by 2030, with interest payments that year exceeding $1.3tn. 

f $4tn-$5tn. As a result, they also know they cannot make the tax cuts permanent, because permanently higher deficits would violate the rules for reconciliation.

Enter, now, the tax cheats. What if, they ask, we just pretend the tax cuts are not supposed to expire? Sure, they expire under “current law”, which is the basis for estimating their cost. But under “current policy” they are in effect. So if we treat current policy as our baseline, extending it and even making it permanent costs zero dollars. Indeed, allowing the tax cuts to expire would represent history’s largest tax rise. 

he only reason Congress finds itself dealing with expiring tax cuts in the first place is that these same tax cheats wanted to use the fact of expiration to make their last cuts appear less costly. The only reason they were allowed to pass the TCJA in 2017 was because under current law it would not affect the deficit in the long term. Keeping the TCJA rates for the long term was never proposed, nor could it have been approved. It is fundamentally undemocratic to whine that the nation might revert from something it was never asked to support. It is fundamentally innumerate to pretend that there is no cost to making the cuts permanent, when the cost of their permanence has never been accounted for.
