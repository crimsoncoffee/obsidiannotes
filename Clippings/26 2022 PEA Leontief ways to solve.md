(i am preparing for ISI MSQE examination), in detail exposition, explain me the solutions and the related concepts so that I can solve any other similar question image.png

Since you are preparing for the ISI MSQE (Master of Science in Quantitative Economics) examination, I’ll provide a detailed exposition of the solution to the problem you’ve presented, along with related concepts, to ensure you can confidently solve similar questions. The problem involves a Leontief production function, and we need to determine the marginal productivity of labor. Let’s dive in step-by-step.

---

### Problem Statement

You’re given a production function:

$F(K, L) = \min\left\{ \frac{K}{a}, \frac{L}{b} \right\}$

where:

- $K$  is capital, $L$  is labor,
- $a$  and $b$  are positive parameters, and $a \neq b$  ,
- $K$  is fixed at $K = \bar{K} > 0$  .

The task is to find the **marginal productivity of labor (MPL)** and select the correct option from:

- **(A)** 0
- **(B)** $\frac{1}{a}$ if $L < \left(\frac{a}{b}\right) \bar{K}$  and 0 otherwise
- **(C)** $\frac{1}{b}$ if $L < \left(\frac{b}{a}\right) \bar{K}$  and 0 otherwise
- **(D)** None of the above

---

### Step 1: Understanding the Leontief Production Function

The production function $F(K, L) = \min\left\{ \frac{K}{a}, \frac{L}{b} \right\}$  is a **Leontief production function**, which models production processes where inputs (capital and labor) are used in fixed proportions. This is often called a **fixed-proportions production function** because output is limited by the scarcer input relative to a specific ratio determined by $a$  and $b$  .

- **Interpretation of Parameters**:
	- $\frac{K}{a}$  can be thought of as the number of "effective units" of output that capital $K$  can produce, where $a$  is the amount of capital required per unit of output.
	- $\frac{L}{b}$  is the number of "effective units" of output that labor $L$  can produce, where $b$  is the amount of labor required per unit of output.
	- The output $F(K, L)$  equals the smaller of these two quantities, reflecting perfect complementarity: you can’t increase output by adding more of one input unless the other input increases proportionally.

Since $K = \bar{K}$  is fixed, the production function becomes a function of $L$  only:

$F(\bar{K}, L) = \min\left\{ \frac{\bar{K}}{a}, \frac{L}{b} \right\}$

Our goal is to find the **MPL**, which is the partial derivative $\frac{\partial F}{\partial L}$  , or how output changes with an additional unit of labor when capital is held constant.

### Step 2: Analyzing the Production Function with Fixed Capital

Because the function involves a minimum, it’s **piecewise** —the output depends on whether $\frac{\bar{K}}{a}$  or $\frac{L}{b}$  is smaller. Let’s determine the critical point where they are equal:

$\frac{\bar{K}}{a} = \frac{L}{b}$

Solving for $L$  :

$L = \frac{b}{a} \bar{K}$

This is the **threshold** where the limiting factor switches. Now, let’s define the output in different regions:

- **If $L < \frac{b}{a} \bar{K}$** :
	- Then $\frac{L}{b} < \frac{\bar{K}}{a}$  , so the minimum is $\frac{L}{b}$  .
	- Thus, $F(\bar{K}, L) = \frac{L}{b}$  .
	- Here, labor is the **limiting factor** —output is constrained by the amount of labor available.
- **If $L > \frac{b}{a} \bar{K}$** :
	- Then $\frac{L}{b} > \frac{\bar{K}}{a}$  , so the minimum is $\frac{\bar{K}}{a}$  .
	- Thus, $F(\bar{K}, L) = \frac{\bar{K}}{a}$  .
	- Here, capital is the **limiting factor** —output is constrained by the fixed capital $\bar{K}$  .
- **If $L = \frac{b}{a} \bar{K}$** :
	- Then $\frac{\bar{K}}{a} = \frac{L}{b}$  , so $F(\bar{K}, L) = \frac{\bar{K}}{a} = \frac{L}{b}$  .
	- This is the point of perfect proportionality.

So, the production function is:

$$
\begin{cases} 
\frac{L}{b} & \text{if } L < \frac{b}{a} \bar{K} \\
\frac{\bar{K}}{a} & \text{if } L > \frac{b}{a} \bar{K} \\
\frac{\bar{K}}{a} \text{ or } \frac{L}{b} & \text{if } L = \frac{b}{a} \bar{K} \text{ (since they are equal)}
\end{cases}
$$

### Step 3: Calculating the Marginal Productivity of Labor

The MPL is the derivative of $F(\bar{K}, L)$  with respect to $L$  . Since the function is piecewise, we compute the derivative in each region:

- **Region 1: $L < \frac{b}{a} \bar{K}$**
	- $F(\bar{K}, L) = \frac{L}{b}$
	- $\frac{\partial F}{\partial L} = \frac{\partial}{\partial L} \left( \frac{L}{b} \right) = \frac{1}{b}$  (since $b$  is a constant).
	- **Economic Intuition**: When labor is scarce (labor is the limiting factor), adding more labor increases output at a rate of $\frac{1}{b}$  , where $b$  reflects the labor requirement per unit of output.
- **Region 2: $L > \frac{b}{a} \bar{K}$**
	- $F(\bar{K}, L) = \frac{\bar{K}}{a}$
	- $\frac{\partial F}{\partial L} = \frac{\partial}{\partial L} \left( \frac{\bar{K}}{a} \right) = 0$  (since $\frac{\bar{K}}{a}$  is constant with respect to $L$  ).
	- **Economic Intuition**: When capital is the limiting factor, adding more labor doesn’t increase output because capital is fixed, so MPL = 0.
- **At the Kink: $L = \frac{b}{a} \bar{K}$**
	- The function switches from $\frac{L}{b}$  to $\frac{\bar{K}}{a}$  , so it’s not differentiable at this point (the left and right derivatives differ).
	- Left-hand derivative (approaching from $L < \frac{b}{a} \bar{K}$  ): $\frac{1}{b}$  .
	- Right-hand derivative (approaching from $L > \frac{b}{a} \bar{K}$  ): 0.
	- In economics, for Leontief functions, the MPL at the kink is often considered 0 (since adding labor beyond this point yields no additional output), but for multiple-choice purposes, we define it piecewise based on strict inequalities.

Thus, the MPL is:

$$
\begin{cases} 
\frac{1}{b} & \text{if } L < \frac{b}{a} \bar{K} \\
0 & \text{if } L > \frac{b}{a} \bar{K}
\end{cases}
$$

At $L = \frac{b}{a} \bar{K}$  , the MPL isn’t uniquely defined due to the kink, but options typically assign it to the “otherwise” case (we’ll verify this with the choices).

---

### Step 4: Matching with the Options

Let’s compare our result with the options:

- **(A) 0**
	- This suggests MPL is always zero, which is incorrect because MPL = $\frac{1}{b}$  when $L < \frac{b}{a} \bar{K}$  .
- **(B) $\frac{1}{a}$ if $L < \left(\frac{a}{b}\right) \bar{K}$  and 0 otherwise**
	- **Threshold**: $\left(\frac{a}{b}\right) \bar{K} = \frac{a}{b} \bar{K}$  , which differs from our derived threshold $\frac{b}{a} \bar{K}$  (since $a \neq b$  , these are not equal).
	- **Value**: MPL = $\frac{1}{a}$  , but we calculated $\frac{1}{b}$  . Since $a$  is associated with capital and $b$  with labor, $\frac{1}{a}$  doesn’t match the derivative of $\frac{L}{b}$  .
	- This option is incorrect.
- **(C) $\frac{1}{b}$ if $L < \left(\frac{b}{a}\right) \bar{K}$  and 0 otherwise**
	- **Threshold**: $\left(\frac{b}{a}\right) \bar{K} = \frac{b}{a} \bar{K}$  , which is exactly our critical point.
	- **Value**: MPL = $\frac{1}{b}$  when $L < \frac{b}{a} \bar{K}$  , and 0 otherwise (i.e., when $L \geq \frac{b}{a} \bar{K}$  ), which includes the kink point in the zero case.
	- This matches our derivation perfectly.
- **(D) None of the above**
	- This would apply if no option matched, but (C) does.

**Conclusion**: Option **(C)** is correct:  
MPL = $\frac{1}{b}$  if $L < \left(\frac{b}{a}\right) \bar{K}$  and 0 otherwise.

### Step 5: Verification with an Example

Let’s test with numbers to build intuition:

- Suppose $a = 2$  , $b = 1$  , $\bar{K} = 10$  .
- Production function: $F(10, L) = \min\left\{ \frac{10}{2}, \frac{L}{1} \right\} = \min\{ 5, L \}$  .
- Threshold: $\frac{b}{a} \bar{K} = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5$  .
	- If $L < 5$  , $F = L$  , MPL = 1 = $\frac{1}{b}$  (since $b = 1$  ).
	- If $L > 5$  , $F = 5$  , MPL = 0.
	- At $L = 5$  , $F = 5$  , and MPL transitions to 0.
- Option (C): $\frac{1}{1}$  if $L < 5$  , 0 otherwise—matches!
- Option (B): $\frac{1}{2}$  if $L < \frac{a}{b} \bar{K} = 20$  , but MPL = 1 for $L < 5$  , not $\frac{1}{2}$  —doesn’t match.

This confirms (C) is correct.

### Related Concepts for ISI MSQE Preparation

1. **Leontief Production Function**:
	- Models perfect complementarity (e.g., one worker per machine).
	- Output: $F(K, L) = \min\left\{ \frac{K}{a}, \frac{L}{b} \right\}$  .
	- MPL and MPK are zero unless the respective input is limiting.
2. **Marginal Productivity**:
	- MPL = $\frac{\partial F}{\partial L}$  .
	- For Leontief functions, it’s positive only when the input increases output (limiting factor).
3. **Piecewise Functions**:
	- Non-differentiable at the kink; use left/right derivatives or economic context.
	- Options often define MPL piecewise with strict inequalities.
4. **Fixed Proportions**:
	- Optimal input ratio: $\frac{K}{a} = \frac{L}{b}$  or $\frac{K}{L} = \frac{a}{b}$  .
	- Excess input has no effect beyond this point.
5. **Parameter Roles**:
	- $a$  : capital per unit output.
	- $b$  : labor per unit output.
	- MPL depends on $b$  , not $a$  , when labor limits production.

### Solving Similar Questions

**General Approach**:

1. **Identify the Function**: Confirm it’s Leontief ( $\min$  ).
2. **Fix Inputs**: Substitute fixed values (e.g., $K = \bar{K}$  ).
3. **Find the Threshold**: Set $\frac{K}{a} = \frac{L}{b}$  and solve for $L$  .
4. **Define Regions**:
	- $L <$  threshold: $F = \frac{L}{b}$  , MPL = $\frac{1}{b}$  .
	- $L >$  threshold: $F = \frac{K}{a}$  , MPL = 0.
5. **Match Options**: Check coefficients and thresholds.

**Practice Example**:

- $F(K, L) = \min\left\{ \frac{K}{3}, \frac{L}{2} \right\}$  , $K = 6$  .
- $F(6, L) = \min\left\{ \frac{6}{3}, \frac{L}{2} \right\} = \min\{ 2, \frac{L}{2} \}$  .
- Threshold: $2 = \frac{L}{2}$  , $L = 4$  .
- MPL = $\frac{1}{2}$  if $L < 4$  , 0 otherwise.
