comparing the costs and benefits.

freedom allows the people to pursue economic efficiency

generates growth in gross domestic product (GDP) through innovation and rational firm design

government intervention reduces economic efficiency and hampers GDP growth.

is justified only when the societal gains from regulatory compliance outweigh the societal costs.

pure economic freedom suffers from some market failure

market power, externalities, asymmetric information, and public goods

surgically addresses market failure, does not have unintended consequences, and imposes the lowest cost upon society.

wiser to tolerate some market failures

han to harm economic dynamism through poorly designed or implemented interventions.

public-choice theory: Officials and politicians respond to incentives and pursue their self-interest

objective is grounded in market failure.

candid preamble to the present payments law says that the objective of the law is to have the RBI regulate the business of payments

whether an objective is stated when designing the intervention

whether that objective addresses a market failure â€” would significantly streamline the Indian state

Did the intervention deliver? Were the objectives met? Many interventions fail to deliver on their objective and should be reversed.

curbs possibilities for private persons, who respond by innovating less and investing less.

but at what cost?

that imposes minimum equity capital requirements comes with the cost of blocking entry by smaller firms and reducing competition.

waste land imposes economic harm by driving up the capital required by firms, and hampers economic efficiency in land utilisation.

direct costs of compliance

an adverse impact upon the innovation, creativity, and investment of private persons

private industries to behave like public-sector undertakings

RBI controls products and processes in private banks

much like what is done with government banks.

This fear holds back private persons from commitment to activities in India.
