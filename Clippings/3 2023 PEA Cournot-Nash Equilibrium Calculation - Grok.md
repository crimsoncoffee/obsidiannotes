Let’s solve the problem of finding the Cournot-Nash equilibrium output level for each firm in a market with the demand function $p = 100 - q$  , where $p$  is the market price and $q$  is the aggregate demand, and there are 23 firms, each with the cost function $c_i(q_i) = \frac{q_i^2}{2}$  . The options provided are that each firm produces 3 units, 4 units, 5 units, or that the equilibrium is not well-defined. We’ll proceed step-by-step to determine the correct answer.

---

### Step 1: Understanding the Cournot-Nash Equilibrium

In a Cournot-Nash equilibrium, firms compete by choosing their output quantities simultaneously, each taking the other firms’ outputs as fixed. Each firm maximizes its profit, and the equilibrium occurs where no firm can increase its profit by unilaterally changing its output. Since all 23 firms are identical (same cost function), we assume a symmetric equilibrium where each firm produces the same quantity, $q_i$  .

Let:

- $q_i$  : output of firm $i$  ,
- $q = \sum_{i=1}^{23} q_i = 23 q_i$  (in symmetric equilibrium),
- $p = 100 - q = 100 - 23 q_i$  (market price based on total output).

### Step 2: Define the Profit Function

Each firm’s profit is its revenue minus its cost:

- **Revenue**: $p \cdot q_i = (100 - 23 q_i) q_i = 100 q_i - 23 q_i^2$  ,
- **Cost**: $c_i(q_i) = \frac{q_i^2}{2}$  ,
- **Profit**:
	$$
	\pi_i = (100 - 23 q_i) q_i - \frac{q_i^2}{2}
	$$

However, we need to set up the profit function correctly, considering that each firm chooses $q_i$  while taking the output of the other 22 firms as given. Define:

- $q_{-i} = \sum_{j \neq i} q_j$  : total output of all other firms,
- Total output: $q = q_i + q_{-i}$  ,
- Price: $p = 100 - q = 100 - q_i - q_{-i}$  .

So, the profit for firm $i$  is:

$$
\pi_i = p q_i - c_i(q_i) = (100 - q_i - q_{-i}) q_i - \frac{q_i^2}{2}
$$

In a symmetric equilibrium, $q_j = q_i$  for all firms $j$  , and with 22 other firms, $q_{-i} = 22 q_i$  . Thus:

$$
p = 100 - q_i - 22 q_i = 100 - 23 q_i
$$

This matches our initial assumption, but let’s derive the equilibrium by maximizing profit with respect to $q_i$  , treating $q_{-i}$  as fixed.

### Step 3: Maximize Profit

Profit is:

$$
\pi_i = (100 - q_i - q_{-i}) q_i - \frac{q_i^2}{2}
$$

Take the derivative with respect to $q_i$  (since $q_{-i}$  is constant from firm $i$  ’s perspective):

$$
\frac{d\pi_i}{dq_i} = (100 - q_{-i}) - 2 q_i - q_i = 100 - q_{-i} - 3 q_i
$$

Set the derivative to zero (first-order condition for maximization):

$$
100 - q_{-i} - 3 q_i = 0
$$
 
$$
3 q_i = 100 - q_{-i}
$$
 
$$
q_i = \frac{100 - q_{-i}}{3}
$$

### Step 4: Symmetric Equilibrium

Since all firms are identical, $q_i = q_j$  for all $j$  , and:

$$
q_{-i} = 22 q_i
$$

Substitute into the equation:

$$
q_i = \frac{100 - 22 q_i}{3}
$$

Multiply through by 3:

$$
3 q_i = 100 - 22 q_i
$$
 
$$
3 q_i + 22 q_i = 100
$$
 
$$
25 q_i = 100
$$
 
$$
q_i = \frac{100}{25} = 4
$$

So, each firm produces 4 units.

### Step 5: Verify the Equilibrium

- Total output: $q = 23 \cdot 4 = 92$  ,
- Price: $p = 100 - 92 = 8$  ,
- Revenue per firm: $8 \cdot 4 = 32$  ,
- Cost per firm: $\frac{4^2}{2} = \frac{16}{2} = 8$  ,
- Profit per firm: $32 - 8 = 24$  .

Check if $q_i = 4$  is optimal when others produce 4:

- $q_{-i} = 22 \cdot 4 = 88$  ,
- Profit if firm $i$  produces $q_i'$  :
	$$
	p = 100 - q_i' - 88 = 12 - q_i'
	$$
	 
	$$
	\pi_i' = (12 - q_i') q_i' - \frac{(q_i')^2}{2}
	$$
	 Derivative:
	$$
	\frac{d\pi_i'}{dq_i'} = 12 - 2 q_i' - q_i' = 12 - 3 q_i'
	$$
	 Set to zero:
	$$
	12 - 3 q_i' = 0 \Rightarrow q_i' = 4
	$$

This confirms that producing 4 units is the best response, satisfying the Nash equilibrium.

### Step 6: Check Other Options

- **$q_i = 3$** :
	- $q = 23 \cdot 3 = 69$  ,
	- $p = 100 - 69 = 31$  ,
	- Profit: $31 \cdot 3 - \frac{3^2}{2} = 93 - 4.5 = 88.5$  ,
	- If deviate to 4, $q_{-i} = 22 \cdot 3 = 66$  , $p = 100 - 4 - 66 = 30$  , profit = $30 \cdot 4 - \frac{4^2}{2} = 120 - 8 = 112 > 88.5$  . Not an equilibrium.
- **$q_i = 5$** :
	- $q = 23 \cdot 5 = 115$  ,
	- $p = 100 - 115 = -15$  ,
	- Profit: $-15 \cdot 5 - \frac{5^2}{2} = -75 - 12.5 = -87.5$  (negative, not viable).
- **Not well-defined**: The equilibrium is unique and symmetric due to linear demand and convex costs.

### Conclusion

The Cournot-Nash equilibrium output level for each firm is 4 units, corresponding to option (b).

**Answer**: (b) each firm produces 4 units

why is the profit function like that

To understand why the profit function is structured as it is in this Cournot-Nash equilibrium problem, let’s break it down step by step in a clear and logical way.

In a Cournot model, firms compete by choosing how much to produce (their output quantities), and each firm assumes that the quantities produced by the other firms are fixed. The market price is determined by the total quantity produced by all firms together. Here, we have 23 firms, all identical, with the same cost function, and a market demand function given by:

$p = 100 - q$

where $p$  is the price, and $q$  is the total quantity produced by all 23 firms, that is:

$q = q_1 + q_2 + \dots + q_{23}$

where $q_i$  is the quantity produced by firm $i$  .

### Defining the Profit Function

For any firm $i$  , its profit, denoted $\pi_i$  , is its revenue minus its cost:

- **Revenue**: This is the price per unit times the quantity it produces, so $\text{Revenue} = p \cdot q_i$  . Since the price depends on the total quantity, we substitute $p = 100 - q$  , giving:

$\text{Revenue} = (100 - q) \cdot q_i$

- **Cost**: The cost function for firm $i$  is given as $c_i(q_i) = \frac{q_i^2}{2}$  .

Thus, the profit for firm $i$  is:

$\pi_i = \text{Revenue} - \text{Cost} = (100 - q) \cdot q_i - \frac{q_i^2}{2}$

### Incorporating Total Quantity

Since $q$  is the total quantity produced by all firms, we can express it as:

$q = q_i + \sum_{j \neq i} q_j$

Here, $q_i$  is the output of firm $i$  , and $\sum_{j \neq i} q_j$  is the sum of the outputs of all other firms (the 22 other firms in this case). To make this clearer, we define:

$q_{-i} = \sum_{j \neq i} q_j$

So, the total quantity becomes:

$q = q_i + q_{-i}$

Now, substitute this into the price function:

$p = 100 - q = 100 - (q_i + q_{-i})$

The revenue for firm $i$  then becomes:

$\text{Revenue} = p \cdot q_i = (100 - q_i - q_{-i}) \cdot q_i$

Combining this with the cost, the profit function for firm $i$  is:

$\pi_i = (100 - q_i - q_{-i}) q_i - \frac{q_i^2}{2}$

### Why This Form?

This profit function is structured this way because:

1. **Market Price Dependency**: The price $p = 100 - q$  depends on the total output of all firms, not just firm $i$  ’s output. By writing $q = q_i + q_{-i}$  , we explicitly account for firm $i$  ’s contribution ( $q_i$  ) and the contribution of all other firms ( $q_{-i}$  ), which firm $i$  takes as given in the Cournot model.
2. **Firm’s Decision-Making**: In the Cournot-Nash equilibrium, each firm chooses its own quantity $q_i$  to maximize its profit, treating the output of all other firms $q_{-i}$  as fixed. The term $q_{-i}$  in the profit function reflects this assumption, allowing firm $i$  to optimize based on the market conditions influenced by others.
3. **Cost Structure**: The cost $\frac{q_i^2}{2}$  is specific to firm $i$  ’s production and is subtracted from the revenue to give the net profit. The quadratic form indicates increasing marginal costs, which is realistic in many production scenarios and affects the firm’s optimal output choice.

### Verification in Equilibrium

To see how this works in practice, consider the Nash equilibrium where each firm maximizes its profit. Firm $i$  takes the derivative of $\pi_i$  with respect to $q_i$  (treating $q_{-i}$  as constant) and sets it to zero:

$\frac{d\pi_i}{dq_i} = 100 - 2q_i - q_{-i} - q_i = 100 - 3q_i - q_{-i} = 0$

Solving:

$3q_i = 100 - q_{-i}$

$q_i = \frac{100 - q_{-i}}{3}$

Since all 23 firms are identical (symmetric), in equilibrium, each firm produces the same quantity, so $q_i = q_j$  for all firms. Thus, $q_{-i} = 22 q_i$  (the output of the 22 other firms), and we substitute:

$q_i = \frac{100 - 22 q_i}{3}$

Multiply through by 3:

$3 q_i = 100 - 22 q_i$

$25 q_i = 100$

$q_i = 4$

So, each firm produces 4 units, total quantity is $q = 23 \cdot 4 = 92$  , and price is $p = 100 - 92 = 8$  , which is consistent with the Cournot framework.

### Conclusion

The profit function $\pi_i = (100 - q_i - q_{-i}) q_i - \frac{q_i^2}{2}$  is designed this way because it captures the interplay between a firm’s own output, the collective output of its competitors, and the resulting market price, while subtracting the firm’s production costs. This setup allows each firm to strategically choose its output to maximize profit in a competitive environment where total supply drives the price.

what are some expressions that I can remember to get these solved very quickly

To quickly solve Cournot-Nash equilibrium problems, especially for multiple firms with linear demand and quadratic costs, you can memorize a few key expressions. These shortcuts will allow you to bypass lengthy derivations and directly compute equilibrium quantities, total output, and prices. Below, I’ve outlined the most useful expressions, tailored to common setups like the one you might encounter, along with explanations to help you apply them confidently.

### Key Expressions for Quick Solving

#### 1\. Cournot with Linear Demand and Quadratic Costs

- **Setup**:
	- Demand: $p = a - b q$  , where $q = \sum_{i=1}^N q_i$  is the total output of $N$  firms.
	- Cost per firm: $c(q_i) = \frac{k q_i^2}{2}$  (marginal cost $mc_i = k q_i$  , increasing with output).
- **Equilibrium Output per Firm**:
	$$
	q_i = \frac{a}{b (N + 1) + k}
	$$
	- All firms produce the same quantity in a symmetric equilibrium.
- **Total Output**:
	$$
	q = N q_i = \frac{N a}{b (N + 1) + k}
	$$
- **Price**:
	$$
	p = a - b q = a - b \left( \frac{N a}{b (N + 1) + k} \right)
	$$
- **Use When**: You have linear demand and quadratic costs with a coefficient $k$  in the cost function.

#### 2\. Special Case: p=a−q p = a - q and c(qi)=qi22 c(q\_i) = \\frac{q\_i^2}{2}

- **Setup**:
	- Demand: $p = a - q$  (here, $b = 1$  ).
	- Cost: $c(q_i) = \frac{q_i^2}{2}$  (so $k = 1$  ).
- **Equilibrium Output per Firm**:
	$$
	q_i = \frac{a}{N + 2}
	$$
- **Total Output**:
	$$
	q = \frac{N a}{N + 2}
	$$
- **Price**:
	$$
	p = a - q = a - \frac{N a}{N + 2} = a \left( \frac{2}{N + 2} \right)
	$$
- **Use When**: The demand slope is 1 ( $b = 1$  ) and the cost function has a coefficient of $\frac{1}{2}$  (so $k = 1$  ), which is common in problems like $p = 100 - q$  .

#### 3\. Cournot with Linear Demand and Zero Costs

- **Setup**:
	- Demand: $p = a - b q$  .
	- Cost: $c(q_i) = 0$  .
- **Equilibrium Output per Firm**:
	$$
	q_i = \frac{a}{b (N + 1)}
	$$
- **Total Output**:
	$$
	q = \frac{N a}{b (N + 1)}
	$$
- **Price**:
	$$
	p = \frac{a}{N + 1}
	$$
- **Use When**: Costs are zero, simplifying the problem significantly.

#### 4\. Cournot with Linear Demand and Constant Marginal Cost

- **Setup**:
	- Demand: $p = a - b q$  .
	- Cost per firm: Marginal cost = $c$  (constant).
- **Equilibrium Output per Firm**:
	$$
	q_i = \frac{a - c}{b (N + 1)}
	$$
- **Total Output**:
	$$
	q = \frac{N (a - c)}{b (N + 1)}
	$$
- **Price**:
	$$
	p = \frac{a + N c}{N + 1}
	$$
- **Use When**: Marginal costs are constant rather than increasing (unlike quadratic costs).

### Examples to Memorize the Expressions

#### Example 1: p=100−q p = 100 - q, c(qi)=qi22 c(q\_i) = \\frac{q\_i^2}{2}, N=23 N = 23

- Use the special case formula: $q_i = \frac{a}{N + 2}$  .
- $a = 100$  , $N = 23$  .
- $q_i = \frac{100}{23 + 2} = \frac{100}{25} = 4$  .
- Total output: $q = N q_i = 23 \times 4 = 92$  .
- Price: $p = 100 - 92 = 8$  .

#### Example 2: p=50−2q p = 50 - 2q, c(qi)=3qi22 c(q\_i) = \\frac{3 q\_i^2}{2}, N=3 N = 3

- Use the general formula: $q_i = \frac{a}{b (N + 1) + k}$  .
- $a = 50$  , $b = 2$  , $k = 3$  , $N = 3$  .
- $q_i = \frac{50}{2 (3 + 1) + 3} = \frac{50}{2 \times 4 + 3} = \frac{50}{8 + 3} = \frac{50}{11} \approx 4.55$  .
- Total output: $q = 3 \times \frac{50}{11} = \frac{150}{11} \approx 13.64$  .
- Price: $p = 50 - 2 \times \frac{150}{11} = 50 - \frac{300}{11} \approx 22.73$  .

#### Example 3: p=100−q p = 100 - q, c(qi)=0 c(q\_i) = 0, N=2 N = 2

- Use the zero-cost formula: $q_i = \frac{a}{b (N + 1)}$  .
- $a = 100$  , $b = 1$  , $N = 2$  .
- $q_i = \frac{100}{1 \times (2 + 1)} = \frac{100}{3} \approx 33.33$  .
- Total output: $q = 2 \times \frac{100}{3} = \frac{200}{3} \approx 66.67$  .
- Price: $p = 100 - \frac{200}{3} = \frac{100}{3} \approx 33.33$  .

### Tips for Quick Application

- **Identify Parameters**: Quickly note $a$  , $b$  , $N$  , and the cost structure ( $k$  for quadratic costs or $c$  for constant costs).
- **Match the Formula**: Choose the expression based on whether costs are zero, constant, or quadratic.
- **Check Intuition**:
	- For $N = 1$  (monopoly), output should be higher than for $N > 1$  .
	- As $N$  increases, $q_i$  decreases, and total output $q$  approaches a competitive level where price equals marginal cost.
- **Simplify When Possible**: If $b = 1$  and $k = 1$  , use $q_i = \frac{a}{N + 2}$  for quadratic costs.

---

### Final Shortcut to Remember

For the specific case of **linear demand $p = a - q$  and quadratic costs $c(q_i) = \frac{q_i^2}{2}$** with $N$  firms, memorize:

$$
q_i = \frac{a}{N + 2}
$$

This will cover many problems like the one with $p = 100 - q$  and $N = 23$  , where $q_i = \frac{100}{25} = 4$  . For more general cases, use $q_i = \frac{a}{b (N + 1) + k}$  , adjusting $b$  and $k$  as needed.

By keeping these expressions in mind, you’ll be able to solve Cournot-Nash equilibrium problems quickly and efficiently!

In some questions we use marginal cost and in some questions total cost for profit calculation why is it so, and when to know what to know

In economics, profit calculations can involve either **marginal cost (MC)** or **total cost (TC)**, and the choice between them depends on the specific question being asked—whether it’s about finding the profit amount or determining the optimal output level. Let’s explore why this happens and how to know which one to use.

---

### Understanding the Terms

- **Total Cost (TC)**: This is the full cost a firm pays to produce a certain quantity of goods. It includes **fixed costs** (like rent, which don’t change with output) and **variable costs** (like materials, which do change with output). For example, if a firm produces $q$  units, its total cost is $TC(q) = FC + VC(q)$  .
- **Marginal Cost (MC)**: This is the extra cost of producing one more unit. It’s calculated as the change in total cost when output increases by one unit, or mathematically, $MC(q) = \frac{dTC(q)}{dq}$  (the derivative of total cost).
- **Profit**: Profit is total revenue (price × quantity, or $TR = p \cdot q$  ) minus total cost, so $\pi = TR - TC$  .

---

### Why Use Marginal Cost in Some Questions?

Marginal cost is used when the goal is to find the **optimal quantity** a firm should produce to maximize profit. Firms make decisions by comparing the additional revenue from selling one more unit ( **marginal revenue, MR** ) to the additional cost of producing it (MC). The rule is:

- Produce more if $MR > MC$  (it adds to profit).
- Produce less if $MR < MC$  (it reduces profit).
- Stop where $MR = MC$  (profit is maximized).

For example:

- **Perfect Competition**: Here, firms take the market price as given, so $MR = p$  . They produce where $p = MC$  . If $p = 10$  and $MC = 5 + 2q$  , set $10 = 5 + 2q$  , and solve to get $q = 2.5$  .
- **Monopoly**: A monopolist faces a downward-sloping demand curve (e.g., $p = 100 - q$  ), so $MR = 100 - 2q$  and $MC = q$  (if $TC = \frac{q^2}{2}$  ). Set $MR = MC$  : $100 - 2q = q$  , so $q = \frac{100}{3}$  .

In these cases, MC helps determine **how much to produce**, not the profit itself.

---

### Why Use Total Cost in Some Questions?

Total cost is used when you need to calculate the **actual profit** a firm earns at a specific output level. The profit formula $\pi = TR - TC$  requires TC to give you a dollar amount. For instance:

- From the perfect competition example above: At $q = 2.5$  , $TR = 10 \cdot 2.5 = 25$  , and if $TC(q) = 5q + q^2$  , then $TC = 5 \cdot 2.5 + (2.5)^2 = 12.5 + 6.25 = 18.75$  . Profit is $\pi = 25 - 18.75 = 6.25$  .
- You can’t calculate this profit using only MC—you need TC.

Total cost is also used when comparing profits at different output levels or when fixed costs matter (e.g., deciding whether to stay in business in the long run).

---

### When to Use Which?

Here’s how to decide based on the question:

- **Use Marginal Cost**:
	- When asked for the **optimal output** or quantity that maximizes profit.
	- In scenarios like “What quantity should the firm produce?” or “Where does the firm set output?”
	- Common in perfect competition ( $p = MC$  ) or monopoly ( $MR = MC$  ).
	- Focus is on **decision-making**, not the profit value.
- **Use Total Cost**:
	- When asked to calculate the **actual profit** in dollars (or another currency).
	- In questions like “What is the firm’s profit at this quantity?” or “Should the firm enter/exit the market?” (where fixed costs affect the total).
	- Focus is on **profit outcomes**, not just output.

---

### Practical Examples

1. **Question**: “A firm in perfect competition has $TC = 5q + q^2$  and price $p = 10$  . What’s the optimal output?”
	- Use MC: $MC = 5 + 2q$  , set $p = MC$  , so $10 = 5 + 2q$  , $q = 2.5$  .
2. **Question**: “What’s the profit at that output?”
	- Use TC: $TR = 10 \cdot 2.5 = 25$  , $TC = 5 \cdot 2.5 + (2.5)^2 = 18.75$  , $\pi = 25 - 18.75 = 6.25$  .
3. **Question**: “A monopolist has $p = 100 - q$  and $TC = \frac{q^2}{2}$  . What’s the profit-maximizing quantity?”
	- Use MC: $MR = 100 - 2q$  , $MC = q$  , set $100 - 2q = q$  , $q = \frac{100}{3}$  .
4. **Question**: “What’s the profit at that quantity?”
	- Use TC: $p = 100 - \frac{100}{3} = \frac{200}{3}$  , $TR = \frac{200}{3} \cdot \frac{100}{3} = \frac{20000}{9}$  , $TC = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{100}{3} \right)^2 = \frac{5000}{9}$  , $\pi = \frac{20000}{9} - \frac{5000}{9} = \frac{15000}{9} = 1666.67$  .

### Summary

- **Marginal Cost**: Use it to find the **quantity** that maximizes profit ( $MR = MC$  ).
- **Total Cost**: Use it to calculate the **profit** itself ( $\pi = TR - TC$  ).
- **How to Know**: Check the question—if it’s about “how much to produce,” use MC; if it’s about “how much profit,” use TC. Often, you’ll use MC first to find the quantity, then TC to find the profit! https://grok.com/chat/79909fd5-f4fa-4bf0-935a-73343016d673
