e-Kuber is the Core Banking Solution of Reserve Bank of India.

E-Kuber provides the provision of a single current account for each bank across the country, with decentralised access to this account from anywhere-anytime using portal based services in a safe manner.

Core Banking Solutions (CBS) can be defined

a solution that enables banks to offer a multitude of customer-centric services on a 24x7 basis from a single location, supporting retail as well as corporate banking activities, as well as all possible delivery channels existing and proposed

centralisation thus makes a “one-stop” shop for financial services a reality. Using CBS, customers can access their accounts from any branch, anywhere, irrespective of where they have physically opened their accounts.

Almost all branches of commercial banks, including the [Regional Rural Banks](http://arthapedia.in/index.php?title=Regional_Rural_Banks) (RRBs), are brought into the core-banking fold.

Core Banking Solutions (CBS) marked a paradigm shift as it made a bank’s particular branch customers, now bank customers as they can access their accounts from any branch for defined purposes. CBS links all branches of a bank and offers opportunities for information management, better customer service and improved risk management. 

e-Kuber enables ease of operations. The system also benefits state /central Governments as users. Some of the facilities offered include the provision of portal based access which allows Government departments to access on anywhere-anytime basis and view their balances – of all types including the Ways and Means Advances, drawings, funds positions and the like – all in a consolidated manner so as to help them in better funds management.

capability of consolidating revenue collections by banks through the e-Kuber offers the potential for better flexibility for the Government in managing its finances apart from moving over towards higher levels of electronic banking.

The e-kuber system can be accessed either through [INFINET](http://www.idrbt.ac.in/infinet.html) or Internet. The INFINET is a Closed User Group Network for the exclusive use of member banks and financial institutions and is the communication backbone for the National Payments System, which caters mainly to inter-bank applications like Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS), Delivery Vs Payment, Government Transactions, Automatic Clearing House, etc.

The e-kuber system, implemented in 2012, is reported to be one of the foremost central bank oriented Core Banking Systems in the world.

Auction of Government securities is done through e-kuber system. [Sovereign Gold Bonds](http://www.arthapedia.in/index.php?title=Sovereign_Gold_Bonds) are available for subscription at the branches of scheduled commercial banks and designated post offices through RBI’s e-kuber system. [Goods and Service Tax](http://arthapedia.in/index.php?title=Goods_and_Services_Tax) (GST) settlements are also proposed to be done through e-kuber. On 7 April 2016, RBI launched a platform to enable trading in the priority sector lending certificates (PSLC) through its Core Banking Solution (CBS) portal (e-Kuber).

Technology partner for RBI for launching e-kuber is Polaris Ltd. http://www.arthapedia.in/index.php/E-Kuber
