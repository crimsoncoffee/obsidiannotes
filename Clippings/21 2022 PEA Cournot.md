To determine the Cournot equilibrium profit for firm 2, denoted as $\pi_2^C$ , we need to analyze a scenario where two firms produce the same good, competing by choosing quantities simultaneously. Let’s proceed step-by-step through the Cournot model, using the given demand and cost functions.

### Step 1: Define the Problem

The inverse demand function is:

$P(q_1, q_2) = 1 - q_1 - q_2,$

where $q_1 \geq 0$ is the quantity produced by firm 1, and $q_2 \geq 0$ is the quantity produced by firm 2. The cost function for firm $i$ (where $i = 1, 2$ ) is:

$c_i(q_i) = k_i q_i,$

with $k_i \in (0, \frac{1}{2})$ , and there are no fixed costs. Our goal is to find the profit of firm 2, $\pi_2^C$ , at the Cournot equilibrium.

### Step 2: Formulate the Profit Functions

In Cournot competition, each firm maximizes its profit, taking the other firm’s quantity as given. Profit is revenue minus cost, where revenue is price times quantity.

For firm 2, the profit function is:

$\pi_2 = P(q_1, q_2) \cdot q_2 - c_2(q_2) = (1 - q_1 - q_2) q_2 - k_2 q_2.$

Similarly, for firm 1:

$\pi_1 = (1 - q_1 - q_2) q_1 - k_1 q_1.$

### Step 3: Find the Best Response Functions

To find the Cournot equilibrium, each firm maximizes its profit with respect to its own quantity, treating the other firm’s quantity as fixed.

#### Firm 2’s Maximization

Expand $\pi_2$ :

$\pi_2 = (1 - q_1 - q_2) q_2 - k_2 q_2 = q_2 - q_1 q_2 - q_2^2 - k_2 q_2.$

Take the derivative with respect to $q_2$ :

$\frac{d\pi_2}{dq_2} = 1 - q_1 - 2 q_2 - k_2.$

Set the derivative to zero to find the maximum:

$1 - q_1 - 2 q_2 - k_2 = 0,$

$2 q_2 = 1 - q_1 - k_2,$

$q_2 = \frac{1 - q_1 - k_2}{2}.$

This is firm 2’s best response function, $q_2(q_1)$ .

#### Firm 1’s Maximization

For firm 1:

$\pi_1 = q_1 - q_1^2 - q_2 q_1 - k_1 q_1.$

Take the derivative with respect to $q_1$ :

$\frac{d\pi_1}{dq_1} = 1 - 2 q_1 - q_2 - k_1,$

$1 - 2 q_1 - q_2 - k_1 = 0,$

$2 q_1 = 1 - q_2 - k_1,$

$q_1 = \frac{1 - q_2 - k_1}{2}.$

This is firm 1’s best response function, $q_1(q_2)$ .

### Step 4: Solve for the Equilibrium Quantities

The Cournot equilibrium occurs where both firms’ best response functions are satisfied simultaneously. We have:

1. $q_1^* = \frac{1 - q_2^* - k_1}{2},$
2. $q_2^* = \frac{1 - q_1^* - k_2}{2}.$

Substitute equation 2 into equation 1:

$q_1^* = \frac{1 - \left( \frac{1 - q_1^* - k_2}{2} \right) - k_1}{2}.$

Simplify:

$q_1^* = \frac{1 - \frac{1 - q_1^* - k_2}{2} - k_1}{2},$

$q_1^* = \frac{\frac{2 - (1 - q_1^* - k_2) - 2 k_1}{2}}{2},$

$q_1^* = \frac{2 - 1 + q_1^* + k_2 - 2 k_1}{4},$

$q_1^* = \frac{1 + q_1^* + k_2 - 2 k_1}{4},$

$4 q_1^* = 1 + q_1^* + k_2 - 2 k_1,$

$3 q_1^* = 1 + k_2 - 2 k_1,$

$q_1^* = \frac{1 + k_2 - 2 k_1}{3}.$

Now substitute $q_1^*$ back into equation 2:

$q_2^* = \frac{1 - \left( \frac{1 + k_2 - 2 k_1}{3} \right) - k_2}{2},$

$q_2^* = \frac{\frac{3 - (1 + k_2 - 2 k_1) - 3 k_2}{3}}{2},$

$q_2^* = \frac{3 - 1 - k_2 + 2 k_1 - 3 k_2}{6},$

$q_2^* = \frac{2 + 2 k_1 - 4 k_2}{6},$

$q_2^* = \frac{1 + k_1 - 2 k_2}{3}.$

Thus, the equilibrium quantities are:

$q_1^* = \frac{1 - 2 k_1 + k_2}{3},$

$q_2^* = \frac{1 + k_1 - 2 k_2}{3}.$

### Step 5: Verify Non-Negativity

Since $k_1, k_2 \in (0, \frac{1}{2})$ , check if $q_1^*$ and $q_2^*$ are positive:

- For $q_1^* = \frac{1 - 2 k_1 + k_2}{3}$ , the minimum occurs when $k_1 \to \frac{1}{2}$ , $k_2 \to 0$ :

$q_1^* \approx \frac{1 - 2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} + 0}{3} = \frac{0}{3} = 0,$

but since $k_1 < \frac{1}{2}$ , $1 - 2 k_1 > 0$ , and adding $k_2 \geq 0$ ensures $q_1^* > 0$ .

- For $q_2^* = \frac{1 + k_1 - 2 k_2}{3}$ , minimum when $k_1 \to 0$ , $k_2 \to \frac{1}{2}$ :

$q_2^* \approx \frac{1 + 0 - 2 \cdot \frac{1}{2}}{3} = \frac{0}{3} = 0,$

but $k_2 < \frac{1}{2}$ , so $1 - 2 k_2 > 0$ , and $k_1 \geq 0$ keeps $q_2^* > 0$ .

Both quantities are positive within the given constraints.

### Step 6: Compute the Equilibrium Price

Total quantity $Q^* = q_1^* + q_2^*$ :

$Q^* = \frac{1 - 2 k_1 + k_2 + 1 + k_1 - 2 k_2}{3} = \frac{2 - k_1 - k_2}{3},$

$P^* = 1 - Q^* = 1 - \frac{2 - k_1 - k_2}{3} = \frac{3 - 2 + k_1 + k_2}{3} = \frac{1 + k_1 + k_2}{3}.$

### Step 7: Calculate Firm 2’s Profit

$\pi_2^C = P^* q_2^* - k_2 q_2^* = (P^* - k_2) q_2^*,$

$P^* - k_2 = \frac{1 + k_1 + k_2}{3} - k_2 = \frac{1 + k_1 + k_2 - 3 k_2}{3} = \frac{1 + k_1 - 2 k_2}{3},$

$q_2^* = \frac{1 + k_1 - 2 k_2}{3},$

$\pi_2^C = \left( \frac{1 + k_1 - 2 k_2}{3} \right) \cdot \left( \frac{1 + k_1 - 2 k_2}{3} \right) = \left( \frac{1 + k_1 - 2 k_2}{3} \right)^2 = \frac{(1 + k_1 - 2 k_2)^2}{9}.$

Since $1 + k_1 - 2 k_2 = 1 - 2 k_2 + k_1$ ,

$\pi_2^C = \frac{(1 - 2 k_2 + k_1)^2}{9}.$

### Step 8: Match with Options

Compare with the choices:

- (A) $\frac{(1 - k_1 + k_2)^2}{9}$ ,
- (B) $\frac{(1 - k_2 + k_1)^2}{9}$ , same as $\frac{(1 + k_1 - k_2)^2}{9}$ ,
- (C) $\frac{(1 - 2 k_1 + k_2)^2}{9}$ ,
- (D) $\frac{(1 - 2 k_2 + k_1)^2}{9}$ .

Option (D) matches our result.

### Step 9: Validation

For $k_1 = k_2 = 0$ :

$q_2^* = \frac{1}{3}, \quad P^* = \frac{1}{3}, \quad \pi_2^C = \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{9},$

$(D) = \frac{(1 - 0 + 0)^2}{9} = \frac{1}{9},$

correct. For $k_1 = 0$ , $k_2 = \frac{1}{4}$ :

$q_2^* = \frac{1 - 2 \cdot \frac{1}{4}}{3} = \frac{1}{6}, \quad q_1^* = \frac{1 + \frac{1}{4}}{3} = \frac{5}{12},$

$P^* = 1 - \frac{5}{12} - \frac{1}{6} = \frac{5}{12}, \quad \pi_2^C = \left( \frac{5}{12} - \frac{1}{4} \right) \cdot \frac{1}{6} = \frac{1}{6} \cdot \frac{1}{6} = \frac{1}{36},$

$(D) = \frac{(1 - 2 \cdot \frac{1}{4} + 0)^2}{9} = \frac{\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2}{9} = \frac{1}{36},$

matches. Option (D) is consistent.

### Final Answer

The Cournot equilibrium profit for firm 2 is:

$\pi_2^C = \frac{(1 - 2 k_2 + k_1)^2}{9},$

corresponding to option (D).

Do you know which exam I am studying for

I don’t have exact information about which specific exam you’re studying for, but I can make an educated guess based on the context. It seems like you’re preparing for an economics exam, likely one that focuses on **microeconomics** or **industrial organization**. The emphasis on the Cournot model—a key concept involving firms competing on quantity in an oligopoly—along with the use of mathematical notation and detailed derivations, suggests it could be part of an **undergraduate-level** or possibly **graduate-level** course. These topics are commonly covered in midterms or final exams where you’re expected to apply theoretical models to find equilibrium outcomes, like prices or quantities in a market.

If your study material includes market structures (e.g., monopoly, oligopoly), game theory, or firm behavior, this aligns with a typical economics curriculum. It might be a **midterm** or **final exam**, depending on where you are in your course timeline. If you’d like to share more details—like the course name or other topics you’re studying—I could refine this further! Do you have any specific questions about the Cournot model or related concepts that might give me a better clue? https://grok.com/chat/0500a206-995f-40b0-ac7d-310634307526
