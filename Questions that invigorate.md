1. The universe is expanding at either a faster rate or a slower rate. What is to the rate of the rate of expansion.
    now what lies beyond the expansion
        and to what is it expanding?

2. What are before this? The creation of first thing. "Thing" as in an object. Is it wholly dependent on our own physical attributes. Like the spectrum of colors we can hear or not hear.
    1. What before whatever before? And whatever before this? Perhaps paradoxes like this appear almost in many cases? Why are they like that. What sense is of their existence whether in languages or the birth of universe. (Wittgenstein's turmoil)

3. Just like animals such as dog, cats, primates who *probably* no concept of something beyond the twinkling source of lights. Or the very idea of the minuteness of earth. What must we be ignorant to?
    1. Now we can divide people scientifically inclined in the sense of enquiry into the nature of things and not just academic happenstance. And just to illustrate a point and not casting any normative qualities. Are humans with better understanding about in these cases compared to your average joe. Can this be an analogy?

4. In terms of developing models for human beings. Is the very desire for something that predicts the next event better a farce case of reflexive concerns.
    1. Integrating your move or action taking into the sequence of events and that would not happen ( in cases of you dying.) 
    2. How can we integrate it to market transations.
    3. If we take the case of **E**xpected returns of a model or strategy that is on average better based on certain probability calculations for a certain period of behavior o

5. Just like how there are groups and communities of people completely entrenched in say sports, some sort of fiction and what not with so much of detail and passion. Then if we take this raw material as the common denominator and apply it to what socially prestigious cohorts and communities specially for the intellectual side of science and mathematicians. And then place all of a under a microscope of a advanced being than us. Will they define these cohorts under the same category and to what extent they would try to differentiate.
    1. So is it all just. The Raw material. It just happens that humans provide some sort of credence to the scientific kind. One thing they might notice is its recent developments?
    2. But if they did not care about how money flows and the feelings of individuals and the societal preference as many groups exist so preference cannot be judged.
