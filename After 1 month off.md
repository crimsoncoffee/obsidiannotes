1.  Feels stupid. All this 

I feel all these constant humdrum of news can be avoided. I enjoyed the off time I had from these sources and my focus on something I want to do.

I can see their rhetoic. The shortsightedness. The superficial appearance of importance.

I see the pointlessness in all the consumption
If I could live without it for so long
I can very well for more.
All I see is just random people random thoughts making buck. Whose Mwtp Oppurtunity cost?

-  I am asking is reading all of those multiple articles from the different publication is even worth it?
