	-Let’s parse the problem step by step:
	**Problem statement**: An $n \times n$ chessboard is subdivided into $n^2$ unit squares by equally spaced lines. The question asks for the total number of squares (of all possible sizes) that appear on the board. 
	A square can be $1 \times 1$, $2 \times 2$, $3 \times 3$, …, up to $n \times n$. We want to sum up how many of each size appear.
	1. **Number of $1 \times 1$ squares**: clearly $n^2$.
	2. **Number of $2 \times 2$ squares**: if you think about how you can place a $2 \times 2$ square on an $n \times n$ grid, you can shift it horizontally in $(n-1)$ ways and vertically in $(n-1)$ ways, giving $(n-1)^2$.
	3. **Number of $3 \times 3$ squares**: similarly, $(n-2)^2$.
	4. **Continuing this logic**:

	- $k \times k$ squares occur $(n-k+1)^2$ times.
	- Hence, the total count of all squares of side $k$ (where $k$ goes from 1 to $n$) is
	  
	  $$
	  \sum_{k=1}^{n} (n-k+1)^2.
	  $$
	  
	  
	  But notice that $(n-k+1)^2$ is just the same as $(1 + (n-k))^2$, and if you rewrite the sum properly, you get:
	  
	  $$
	  \sum_{k=1}^{n} (n-k+1)^2 \;=\; \sum_{k=1}^{n} k^2,
	  $$
	  
	  because as $k$ goes from 1 to $n$, $(n-k+1)$ also takes on each integer from 1 to $n$.
	  
	  Thus, **the total number of squares** on an $n \times n$ chessboard is:
	  
	  $$
	  1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + \cdots + n^2.
	  $$
	  
	  
	  This matches option (B) in your provided choices. 
	  
	  If you want the closed-form expression, you can use the formula for the sum of the first $n$ squares:
	  
	  $$
	  1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + \cdots + n^2 \;=\; \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}.
	  $$
	  
	  
	  Therefore, **the correct answer is** $\boxed{1^2 + 2^2 + \dots + n^2}$, which is option (B). 
	  
	  ---
- ### A Bit More Explanation
	- **Why do we sum up squares?** Because for each possible square size $k$, we’re counting how many ways it can “slide” around on the chessboard.
	- **Visualizing $k \times k$ squares**: You can imagine a $k \times k$ square’s top-left corner. That top-left corner can occupy any cell in an $(n-k+1)\times (n-k+1)$ region (since it can’t go off the board). That’s where the $(n-k+1)^2$ factor comes from.
	- **Re-indexing**: $\sum_{k=1}^{n} (n-k+1)^2$ is just a reversed summation of squares, which is the same as summing $1^2 + 2^2 + \cdots + n^2$.
  
  In practical terms, this formula is used any time you want to count all possible sub-squares in a grid. It shows up not only in chessboard problems but also in computational tasks (like counting square subregions in image processing) and in mathematics competitions.
  
  Hence, the succinct conclusion: **the total number of squares on an $n \times n$ chessboard is $1^2 + 2^2 + \dots + n^2$.**

	- First, let’s restate the situation clearly:
	- There are 10 players, each plays every other player exactly once.
	- Thus, each player plays 9 games, and there are (102)=45\binom{10}{2} = 45 total games.
	- There are no draws; each game has exactly one winner and one loser.
	- Let wiw_i be the number of games won by player ii, and lil_i the number of games lost by player ii.
	- Because each player plays 9 games, we have
	  
	  wi+li  =  9for each i=1,2,…,10.  w_i + l_i \;=\; 9 
	  \quad\text{for each } i=1,2,\dots,10.
	- Also, since each of the 45 games has exactly one winner (and one loser),
	  
	  ∑i=110wi=45and∑i=110li=45.  \sum_{i=1}^{10} w_i = 45
	  \quad\text{and}\quad
	  \sum_{i=1}^{10} l_i = 45.
	  
	  The question asks us to identify the correct relationship among:
	  
	  ∑i=110wi2and∑i=110li2.  \sum_{i=1}^{10} w_i^2
	  \quad\text{and}\quad
	  \sum_{i=1}^{10} l_i^2.
	  
	  ---
	- ## Key Identity:  ∑wi2=∑li2\sum w_i^2 = \sum l_i^2
	  
	  Here’s the simplest way to see it:
	- **From wi+li=9w_i + l_i = 9**, we have wi=9−liw_i = 9 - l_i.
	- Then
	  
	  wi2  =  (9−li)2  =  81  −  18 li  +  li2.  w_i^2 \;=\; (9 - l_i)^2 \;=\; 81 \;-\; 18\,l_i \;+\; l_i^2.
	- Summing over i=1i = 1 to 1010,
	  
	  ∑i=110wi2  =  ∑i=110(81−18 li+li2)  =  10⋅81  −  18∑i=110li  +  ∑i=110li2.  \sum_{i=1}^{10} w_i^2
	  \;=\; \sum_{i=1}^{10} \bigl(81 - 18\,l_i + l_i^2\bigr)
	  \;=\; 10\cdot 81 \;-\; 18\sum_{i=1}^{10} l_i \;+\; \sum_{i=1}^{10} l_i^2.
	- But ∑i=110li=45\sum_{i=1}^{10} l_i = 45. So
	  
	  10⋅81  −  18⋅45  =  810  −  810  =  0.  10\cdot 81 \;-\; 18\cdot 45 \;=\; 810 \;-\; 810 \;=\; 0.
	  
	  Hence,
	  
	  ∑i=110wi2  =  ∑i=110li2.  \sum_{i=1}^{10} w_i^2
	  \;=\; \sum_{i=1}^{10} l_i^2.
	  
	  Therefore, **the sum of the squares of the wins equals the sum of the squares of the losses**.
	  
	  ---
	- ## Checking Against the Options
	  
	  Typically, the multiple-choice statements look like:
	- **(A)** ∑wi2  =  81  −  ∑li2\sum w_i^2 \;=\; 81 \;-\; \sum l_i^2
	- **(B)** ∑wi2  =  ∑li2\sum w_i^2 \;=\; \sum l_i^2
	- **(C)** Some other combination
	- **(D)** None of the above
	  
	  Since we derived ∑wi2=∑li2\sum w_i^2 = \sum l_i^2, the correct choice is:
	  
	  (B)w12+w22+⋯+w102  =  l12+l22+⋯+l102.\boxed{\text{(B)} \quad w_1^2 + w_2^2 + \cdots + w_{10}^2 \;=\; l_1^2 + l_2^2 + \cdots + l_{10}^2.}

    1. First, let’s restate the situation clearly:
        
        - There are 10 players, each plays every other player exactly once.  
        - Thus, each player plays 9 games, and there are $\binom{10}{2} = 45$ total games.  
        - There are no draws; each game has exactly one winner and one loser.  
        - Let $w_i$ be the number of games won by player $i$, and $l_i$ the number of games lost by player $i$.  
        - Because each player plays 9 games, we have
          
        $$
        w_i + l_i \;=\; 9 
            \quad\text{for each } i=1,2,\dots,10.
        $$
        
        - Also, since each of the 45 games has exactly one winner (and one loser),
          
        $$
        \sum_{i=1}^{10} w_i = 45
            \quad\text{and}\quad
            \sum_{i=1}^{10} l_i = 45.
        $$
        
        
        The question asks us to identify the correct relationship among:
        
        $$
        \sum_{i=1}^{10} w_i^2
          \quad\text{and}\quad
          \sum_{i=1}^{10} l_i^2.
        $$
        
        
        ---
        
        ## Key Identity: $\sum w_i^2 = \sum l_i^2$
        
        Here’s the simplest way to see it:
        
        1. **From $w_i + l_i = 9$**, we have $w_i = 9 - l_i$.  
        2. Then
           
        $$
        w_i^2 \;=\; (9 - l_i)^2 \;=\; 81 \;-\; 18\,l_i \;+\; l_i^2.
        $$
        
        3. Summing over $i = 1$ to $10$,
           
        $$
        \sum_{i=1}^{10} w_i^2
             \;=\; \sum_{i=1}^{10} \bigl(81 - 18\,l_i + l_i^2\bigr)
             \;=\; 10\cdot 81 \;-\; 18\sum_{i=1}^{10} l_i \;+\; \sum_{i=1}^{10} l_i^2.
        $$
        
        4. But $\sum_{i=1}^{10} l_i = 45$. So
           
        $$
        10\cdot 81 \;-\; 18\cdot 45 \;=\; 810 \;-\; 810 \;=\; 0.
        $$
        
           Hence,
           
        $$
        \sum_{i=1}^{10} w_i^2
             \;=\; \sum_{i=1}^{10} l_i^2.
        $$
        
        
        Therefore, **the sum of the squares of the wins equals the sum of the squares of the losses**.

	First, let’s restate the sets:
	
	- $S$ is the set of all numbers of the form
	  
	$$
	4^n \;-\; 3n \;-\; 1
		\quad\text{where } n = 1, 2, 3, \dots
	$$
	
	- $T$ is the set of all numbers of the form
	  
	$$
	9(n - 1)
		\quad\text{where } n = 1, 2, 3, \dots
		\quad(\text{i.e.\ }T = \{0,\,9,\,18,\,27,\dots\}).
	$$
	
	
	We have four statements (only one is correct):
	
	1. **(A)** Each number in $S$ is also in $T$.
	2. **(B)** Each number in $T$ is also in $S$.
	3. **(C)** There is no number in $S$ which is in $T$.
	4. **(D)** There is no number in $T$ which is in $S$.
	
	---
	
	## 1. Checking whether every element of $S$ lies in $T$
	
	We want to see if
	
	$$
	4^n \;-\; 3n \;-\; 1
	$$
	
	is always a (nonnegative) multiple of 9. Let’s look at $4^n$ modulo 9:
	
	- $4^1 \equiv 4 \pmod{9}$
	- $4^2 = 16 \equiv 7 \pmod{9}$
	- $4^3 = 64 \equiv 1 \pmod{9}$
	
	Then the pattern repeats every 3 powers (because $4^3 \equiv 1 \pmod{9}$), so:
	
	$$
	4^n \pmod{9} 
	\;=\; 
	\begin{cases}
	4, & n \equiv 1 \pmod{3},\\
	7, & n \equiv 2 \pmod{3},\\
	1, & n \equiv 0 \pmod{3}.
	\end{cases}
	$$
	
	
	Meanwhile, $3n \pmod{9}$ is just:
	
	$$
	3n \pmod{9} 
	\;=\;
	\begin{cases}
	3, & n \equiv 1 \pmod{3},\\
	6, & n \equiv 2 \pmod{3},\\
	0, & n \equiv 0 \pmod{3}.
	\end{cases}
	$$
	
	
	Now compute
	
	$$
	4^n - 3n - 1 \pmod{9}
	$$
	
	in each residue class of $n$:
	
	1. **$n \equiv 1 \pmod{3}$**  
	   $\;4^n \equiv 4,\quad 3n \equiv 3$.  
	   So $4^n - 3n - 1 \equiv 4 - 3 - 1 = 0 \pmod{9}.$
	
	2. **$n \equiv 2 \pmod{3}$**  
	   $\;4^n \equiv 7,\quad 3n \equiv 6$.  
	   So $4^n - 3n - 1 \equiv 7 - 6 - 1 = 0 \pmod{9}.$
	
	3. **$n \equiv 0 \pmod{3}$**  
	   $\;4^n \equiv 1,\quad 3n \equiv 0$.  
	   So $4^n - 3n - 1 \equiv 1 - 0 - 1 = 0 \pmod{9}.$
	
	In *every* case, $4^n - 3n - 1$ is divisible by 9. Moreover, for $n\ge1,$ $4^n$ grows quickly, so $4^n - 3n - 1$ is nonnegative (and in fact grows quite large). Hence each $4^n - 3n - 1$ is a *nonnegative multiple* of 9. 
	
	But that’s exactly the form of the elements of $T$. (Recall $T = \{\,9\cdot 0,\;9\cdot 1,\;9\cdot 2,\dots\}\}.$
	
	Therefore,  
	
	$$
	\boxed{\text{Every number in }S\text{ is indeed in }T.}
	$$
	
	This makes **(A)** a true statement.
	
	---
	
	## 2. Quick Checks of the Other Statements
	
	- **(B)** “Each number in $T$ is also in $S$.”  
	  That would mean *every* nonnegative multiple of 9 appears as $4^n - 3n - 1$. For instance, 18 is in $T$. If 18 were in $S$, we’d need $4^n - 3n - 1 = 18$. Quick trials show there is no integer $n$ that satisfies this (for $n=3$, we get 54; for $n=2$, we get 9; etc.). So (B) is false.
	
	- **(C)** “There is no number in $S$ which is in $T$.”  
	  That’s plainly false because we already see plenty of overlap (e.g.\ $S_1 = 0\in T$, $S_2=9\in T$, etc.).
	
	- **(D)** “There is no number in $T$ which is in $S$.”  
	  That is also false for the same reason: we found common elements like 0, 9, 54, 243, etc.
	
	Hence the *only* correct statement is:
	
	
	$$
	\boxed{\text{(A) Each number in }S\text{ is also in }T.}
	$$
