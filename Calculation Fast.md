### Multiplication
	2by2 multiplication
		will have 
		4 numbers to add
		
		$24 \times 67 =$
		pick any one of the two numbers that 
		24 = 20 + 4
		67 = 60 + 7
		now since are $(a+b)(c+d)$ will give 4 terms
		- Mentally decompose the above[[How to Solve It A New Aspect of Mathematical Method (George Polya) (Z-Library) (1).pdf#page=58&selection=77,9,82,13|em of masses S consists of parts, each of which has its center of gravity in th]][[How to Solve It A New Aspect of Mathematical Method (George Polya) (Z-Library) (1).pdf#page=58&selection=74,64,82,64|How to Solve It A New Aspect of Mathematical Method (George Polya) (Z-Library) (1), p.58]]
		- Now 
			1. taking the tenth digit of the second number, **6**
			2. and tenth of first number that is **2**
			3. multiply and **append two zeroes**
			4. tenth of second **6** x unit of first **4**, **append one zero** and **add with previous**
			5. **unit** of second **7**, **tenth** of first **2**, **append one zero** and **add**
			6. **unit** of second **7**, **unit** of first **4**,  and **add with previous**
		- Three numbers where you have to **append zeroes**
			- **2 zeroes** at the beginning **once**
			- 1 zero, **2 times subsequently**
		- Keeping track of **accurate addition**
		- Sometimes it may be that operation itself yields a number with zero. Such as **4 x 5** = 20, Hence do not forget to append, or do not err to append if they are units.

### Addition
  Given a two digit sums.
      $xy + ab, \text{where a, b, x, y [0,9]}$ 
      $xy + b$ then add $a 10$, easy load
      or
      x+a + y+b
      Or adding up both the digits and if the y+b seems greater >= 10 then automatic increment 
	      Increment can be done before also
	      as first look at y+b see its (but this is the same as normal addition)
		  
### Subtraction
  Should be the key focus now.
     Being able to easily recognize complement of the number into teens.
