Explain this question deeply, steps that I should have taken to solve, how would I have recalled concepts. Be detailed and explain in that way image.png

Let’s dive into solving this utility maximization problem from consumer theory in economics. The goal is to find the optimal values of $x$  and $y$  that maximize the utility function $U(x, y) = -[(10 - x)^2 + (10 - y)^2]$  , given that the prices of both goods are 1 and the consumer’s income is 40. The answer choices are (A) 10, 10; (B) 0, 0; (C) 5, 5; and (D) None of these. I’ll explain the problem deeply, outline the steps to solve it, and discuss how to recall and apply relevant concepts.

### Step 1: Understand the Problem and Key Concepts

In consumer theory, utility maximization involves a consumer choosing quantities of goods to maximize their satisfaction (utility) subject to a budget constraint. The utility function here, $U(x, y) = -[(10 - x)^2 + (10 - y)^2]$  , represents the consumer’s preferences for two goods, $x$  and $y$  . The prices are $p_x = 1$  and $p_y = 1$  , and the income is $I = 40$  . Typically, the budget constraint is:

$p_x x + p_y y \leq I$

Substituting the given values:

$1 \cdot x + 1 \cdot y \leq 40$

$x + y \leq 40$

Additionally, since $x$  and $y$  represent quantities of goods, we assume non-negativity constraints: $x \geq 0$  and $y \geq 0$  . The consumer’s task is to choose $x$  and $y$  within this budget set to maximize utility.

To recall this concept, think of utility maximization as finding the “best” bundle of goods a consumer can afford. Normally, utility functions increase with consumption (e.g., $U = x y$  or $U = x^{0.5} y^{0.5}$  ), and consumers spend all their income to reach the highest indifference curve tangent to the budget line. However, this utility function looks different, so let’s examine it closely.

---

### Step 2: Analyze the Utility Function

The utility function is:

$U(x, y) = -[(10 - x)^2 + (10 - y)^2]$

This is unusual because it’s negative, and it involves squared terms. Let’s explore what it means. The expression inside the brackets, $(10 - x)^2 + (10 - y)^2$  , resembles the squared Euclidean distance from the point $(x, y)$  to $(10, 10)$  :

- When $x = 10$  and $y = 10$  :

$U(10, 10) = -[(10 - 10)^2 + (10 - 10)^2] = -[0 + 0] = 0$

- If $x = 9$  , $y = 9$  :

$U(9, 9) = -[(10 - 9)^2 + (10 - 9)^2] = -[1 + 1] = -2$

- If $x = 11$  , $y = 11$  :

$U(11, 11) = -[(10 - 11)^2 + (10 - 11)^2] = -[1 + 1] = -2$

Since the term $(10 - x)^2 + (10 - y)^2$  is always non-negative (because squares are non-negative), the utility $U = -[\text{that term}]$  is always non-positive, and its maximum value is 0 when the term inside equals zero, i.e., at $x = 10$  , $y = 10$  . As $x$  and $y$  deviate from 10, the squared terms increase, making utility more negative (lower).

This suggests a **bliss point** at $(10, 10)$  , where utility is maximized. Unlike typical utility functions that increase indefinitely with consumption, this function peaks at a specific point and decreases as you move away. To confirm, note that the indifference curves are:

$U = -[(10 - x)^2 + (10 - y)^2] = k$

$(10 - x)^2 + (10 - y)^2 = -k$

Since $-k$  is positive (as $k \leq 0$  ), these are circles centered at $(10, 10)$  , with radius $\sqrt{-k}$  . Higher utility (less negative $k$  ) means a smaller radius, so the highest utility is at the center.

Recalling concepts: This resembles a utility function with satiation, like $U = -(x - a)^2 - (y - b)^2$  , where the consumer prefers a specific bundle (the bliss point) over more or less of the goods.

---

### Step 3: Check Feasibility of the Bliss Point

Since $(10, 10)$  maximizes utility, let’s see if it’s affordable:

$x + y = 10 + 10 = 20$

$20 \leq 40$

This costs 20, which is less than the income of 40, and $x = 10 \geq 0$  , $y = 10 \geq 0$  , so it’s within the budget set. If $(10, 10)$  is feasible and gives the highest possible utility (0), it seems like the optimal choice. But let’s explore further, as standard problems often assume the budget is fully spent ( $x + y = 40$  ).

---

### Step 4: Compare with Budget Boundary and Answer Choices

Since $(10, 10)$  doesn’t exhaust the budget, let’s test points on the budget line $x + y = 40$  and the answer choices:

- **(20, 20)** (on budget line):

$U(20, 20) = -[(10 - 20)^2 + (10 - 20)^2] = -[(-10)^2 + (-10)^2] = -[100 + 100] = -200$

- **(B) (0, 0)**:

$U(0, 0) = -[(10 - 0)^2 + (10 - 0)^2] = -[100 + 100] = -200$

- **(C) (5, 5)**:

$U(5, 5) = -[(10 - 5)^2 + (10 - 5)^2] = -[25 + 25] = -50$

- Another point, say $(0, 40)$  :

$U(0, 40) = -[(10 - 0)^2 + (10 - 40)^2] = -[100 + (-30)^2] = -[100 + 900] = -1000$

Compare:

- $U(10, 10) = 0$
- $U(20, 20) = -200$
- $U(0, 0) = -200$
- $U(5, 5) = -50$
- $U(0, 40) = -1000$

Clearly, $(10, 10)$  gives higher utility than points on the budget line or other options. Points farther from $(10, 10)$  have lower utility due to the increasing squared terms.

---

### Step 5: Apply Optimization Techniques

Typically, we use the Lagrangian method when the budget constraint binds ( $x + y = 40$  ):

$\mathcal{L} = -[(10 - x)^2 + (10 - y)^2] + \lambda (40 - x - y)$

First-order conditions:

1. $\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial x} = -[-2(10 - x)] - \lambda = 2(10 - x) - \lambda = 0$

$\lambda = 2(10 - x)$

1. $\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial y} = 2(10 - y) - \lambda = 0$

$\lambda = 2(10 - y)$

1. $\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \lambda} = 40 - x - y = 0$

$x + y = 40$

Equate (1) and (2):

$2(10 - x) = 2(10 - y)$

$10 - x = 10 - y$

$x = y$

Then, $x + y = 40$  :

$x + x = 40$

$2x = 40$

$x = 20, \quad y = 20$

But $U(20, 20) = -200 < 0$  , so this tangency point is worse. Why? The utility function isn’t quasi-concave (indifference curves are convex circles, not concave), and it decreases beyond the bliss point. The tangency assumes monotonicity, but here, utility has a peak.

Recalling: The marginal rate of substitution (MRS) is:

$MU_x = 2(10 - x), \quad MU_y = 2(10 - y)$

$MRS = \frac{MU_x}{MU_y} = \frac{2(10 - x)}{2(10 - y)} = 1 \text{ when } x = y$

Price ratio = 1, so $x = y$  aligns, but we need the global maximum, not just tangency.

### Step 6: Resolve the Budget Constraint Issue

In standard theory, if utility is locally non-satiated (for any bundle, a nearby bundle gives higher utility), the consumer spends all income. But here:

- At $(10, 10)$  , $U = 0$  .
- Nearby, e.g., $(11, 11)$  , $U = -2 < 0$  .

Utility decreases in all directions, so $(10, 10)$  is a satiation point. If the bliss point is affordable, the consumer chooses it, even if income isn’t fully spent. The budget set $x + y \leq 40$  includes $(10, 10)$  , and no point in the set gives higher utility.

---

### Step 7: Final Answer

Since $(10, 10)$  is feasible and maximizes utility, it’s the optimal choice. Among the options, (A) 10, 10 matches this analysis.

**Optimal values: $x = 10$  , $y = 10$** (Option A).
