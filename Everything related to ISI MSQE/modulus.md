First, let’s restate the sets:

- $S$ is the set of all numbers of the form
  
$$
4^n \;-\; 3n \;-\; 1
    \quad\text{where } n = 1, 2, 3, \dots
$$

- $T$ is the set of all numbers of the form
  
$$
9(n - 1)
    \quad\text{where } n = 1, 2, 3, \dots
    \quad(\text{i.e.\ }T = \{0,\,9,\,18,\,27,\dots\}).
$$


We have four statements (only one is correct):

1. **(A)** Each number in $S$ is also in $T$.
2. **(B)** Each number in $T$ is also in $S$.
3. **(C)** There is no number in $S$ which is in $T$.
4. **(D)** There is no number in $T$ which is in $S$.

## 1. Checking whether every element of $S$ lies in $T$

We want to see if

$$
4^n \;-\; 3n \;-\; 1
$$

is always a (nonnegative) multiple of 9. Let’s look at $4^n$ modulo 9:

- $4^1 \equiv 4 \pmod{9}$
- $4^2 = 16 \equiv 7 \pmod{9}$
- $4^3 = 64 \equiv 1 \pmod{9}$

Then the pattern repeats every 3 powers (because $4^3 \equiv 1 \pmod{9}$), so:

$$
4^n \pmod{9} 
\;=\; 
\begin{cases}
4, & n \equiv 1 \pmod{3},\\
7, & n \equiv 2 \pmod{3},\\
1, & n \equiv 0 \pmod{3}.
\end{cases}
$$


Meanwhile, $3n \pmod{9}$ is just:

$$
3n \pmod{9} 
\;=\;
\begin{cases}
3, & n \equiv 1 \pmod{3},\\
6, & n \equiv 2 \pmod{3},\\
0, & n \equiv 0 \pmod{3}.
\end{cases}
$$


Now compute

$$
4^n - 3n - 1 \pmod{9}
$$

in each residue class of $n$:

1. **$n \equiv 1 \pmod{3}$**  
   $\;4^n \equiv 4,\quad 3n \equiv 3$.  
   So $4^n - 3n - 1 \equiv 4 - 3 - 1 = 0 \pmod{9}.$

2. **$n \equiv 2 \pmod{3}$**  
   $\;4^n \equiv 7,\quad 3n \equiv 6$.  
   So $4^n - 3n - 1 \equiv 7 - 6 - 1 = 0 \pmod{9}.$

3. **$n \equiv 0 \pmod{3}$**  
   $\;4^n \equiv 1,\quad 3n \equiv 0$.  
   So $4^n - 3n - 1 \equiv 1 - 0 - 1 = 0 \pmod{9}.$

In *every* case, $4^n - 3n - 1$ is divisible by 9. Moreover, for $n\ge1,$ $4^n$ grows quickly, so $4^n - 3n - 1$ is nonnegative (and in fact grows quite large). Hence each $4^n - 3n - 1$ is a *nonnegative multiple* of 9. 

But that’s exactly the form of the elements of $T$. (Recall $T = \{\,9\cdot 0,\;9\cdot 1,\;9\cdot 2,\dots\}\}.$

Therefore,  

$$
\boxed{\text{Every number in }S\text{ is indeed in }T.}
$$

This makes **(A)** a true statement.

## 2. Quick Checks of the Other Statements

- **(B)** “Each number in $T$ is also in $S$.”  
  That would mean *every* nonnegative multiple of 9 appears as $4^n - 3n - 1$. For instance, 18 is in $T$. If 18 were in $S$, we’d need $4^n - 3n - 1 = 18$. Quick trials show there is no integer $n$ that satisfies this (for $n=3$, we get 54; for $n=2$, we get 9; etc.). So (B) is false.

- **(C)** “There is no number in $S$ which is in $T$.”  
  That’s plainly false because we already see plenty of overlap (e.g.\ $S_1 = 0\in T$, $S_2=9\in T$, etc.).

- **(D)** “There is no number in $T$ which is in $S$.”  
  That is also false for the same reason: we found common elements like 0, 9, 54, 243, etc.

Hence the *only* correct statement is:


$$
\boxed{\text{(A) Each number in }S\text{ is also in }T.}
$$
