	 2. **Differentiability** 
		 1. df(x)/dx = sin(1/x) not differentiable
		 2. dgx)/dx = hsin(1x)

        **The Cost of the warranty** is not for the consumer, as it says cost. You will have to remove it from what you earn.

    The procedure is like this first seek out what are true without this illusion
        off them you find which contradicts the illusion.
    also focus on "buy more" as it alludes to range of possibilities.

The marginal cost of producing a widget is 4 for each producer. Each widget producer has a capacity constraint to produce only 5 widgets. There are 8 identical individuals who demand 1 widget only, and value each widget at 6. If the firms are maximizing profits, then the following statement is true:]]

## What they mean

            here you mistakenly did (n-4) for every individual  as you substituted when you saw 4
            Since to find total number of matches between the one of the 3 players and the rest
            you need the total number of players except the 3
            n-3, players and n-3 matches to win

                You were on the right track 
                if you just only read what $s_{0}$ is, it was a positive integer and hence you kept wrongly putting 0 on it.
