### Prejudice is bad 
A year or so ago you would look at these questions and think how hard they were. Granted studying that Varian Textbook and doing those workouts helped immensely.
 But yeah you would think and try to search for if there was only a way to get the solutions of these problems that see in the question papers. 
But look at now these reasoning models have completely tipped the course of the problem solving and the availability of the solution.

It seem  that all you need to know at least for the PEA portion is the economic theory encompassing all sorts of transactions and what happens when there is comparative statics sort of change. 
And ability to understand how a given a function behaves given the variables and the relationship with the Dependent in the economic theory.
