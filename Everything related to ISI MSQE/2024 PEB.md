The worker can be of high ability (θ = 2) or low ability (θ = 1), with the worker knowing her own ability (ability is exogenously given). Note that it is less costly for the worker to achieve a particular level of education if she were of high ability than if she were of low ability. The worker can be hired by a firm paying wage w, and if hired, her marginal product is θ,]]
